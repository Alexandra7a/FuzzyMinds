20511,"Okay this may seem like a dumb question to a lot of you but just hear me out and please keep the judgement to a minimum. I'm sharing this because I genuinely want to change for the better after living like this for 20 years.

For a little background, I grew up in a household where my mother and I weren't on the best terms and all she did as I grew up was work occasionally and sleep in bed all day long. Microwave dinners were a regular thing for me and my brothers, I did pretty bad in school blah blah blah. The big thing was, I was never taught good hygiene as a kid. It was never required or encouraged enforced. I grew up and went through high school without showering regularly, doing assignments, or even engaging with many people outside of school because my mom didn't allow me to get out of the house much. I'd spend my time, playing games, reading, and a loooot of media. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a weird smelly kid in highschool (surprisingly with the whole shower thing. I didn't sweat or anything and always used deodorant and perfume clean clothes etc.) I had a lot of friends that I talked to daily up until senior year. My senior year was when Covid hit and everyone was in quarantine. When school started back up I never went because it was online. That same year I moved in with a new bf and his dad and uncle and since I was so accustomed to staying in a room all day without socializing or doing anything, that's what I did there. I dropped out of highschool and lived with my new boyfriend at the time for two years and to this I realized that I still never leave the room I stay in. Even when my bf has a job that requires him to travel for work, I stay in the hotel room still having horrible hygiene habits (although again not smelling bad or anything) and consuming lots of media from the bed. I'd have moments where come to the realization that l've spent days, weeks, then months doing the exact same thing and wasting the entire day away doing absolutely nothing. It's only dawned on me now that something could be wrong and I should hear other's opinions on it. Of course I'm using a throw away because sharing this is embarrassing enough. I've never considered myself depressed and honestly I never want to but every time Hook up what l'm dealing with su*cide and help websites pop up...

I don't know how to go about this and I genuinely want to do better, so if anyone knows some steps I can take to doing better, I'd really appreciate it.
I've been like this my entire life because it's just how grew up but don't want to waste away any longer.",depression

I have struggled to cope with the abuse I faced. I have also struggled with letting people in because of my distrust. As my depression increased, my friends became “uncomfortable” around me saying I “bring down the vibes”. They stopped inviting me to things, texting me, and calling. My brother told me that he would cut me off if I continued to live life as I am. Now I am a sophomore in college and I have lost majority of the people around me because I don’t know which is better for others: to stay in their lives even tho it hurts them when I’m around or cut off contact with those around me even if they claim they want me around.

20097,"It’s midnight. I have to get up at asscrack early tomorrow. I can’t go to sleep because of how fucking anxious I am. I feel like everyone fucking hates me and tolerates me for some reason. Maybe because they’re scared, maybe some sort of pity, I don’t know. I’m sick of being yelled at whenever I’m at home, I’m sick of it all. I can’t do this. I want out so badly but I can’t get away. I cried in school today because she screamed at me in the car. She didn’t care at all. Does anyone fucking care? People say they do, but realistically, there’s no reason. I wish people would just get it out of the way and stop being fucking pussies and just tell me if they had an issue so I could stop being a fucking burden. I’m pissed and I’m scared and I hate myself and I hate people around me and I wish I could just end it all right here and right now but I can’t because IM TOO MUCH OF A PUSSY. The closest thing I can do is starve myself and throw my guts up, which is a fun little tradition that I’ve had for over a year. Thankfully, my mother, being the kind soul she is, tells me that is bad and will make me fat. Thanks mom! I’m just so sick of this. I’m powerless and weak and I know I am and I wish I had access to a rope right now. I’ll probably forget all about this in the morning too, it’s just that today was a fucking hell day.

20367,"Hello all, I'm just having a rough day today and wanted to ask for any advice you may have. How do you guys cope with the depressive thoughts, self-hatred, insecurity, and body dysmorphia? Usually, my music is enough to block them out for a little, but it's not working today. I already took my antidepressant and I'm not sure what else to try. I have a meeting today, and I'm incredibly anxious about it. I feel horribly ugly and pretty much worthless. I know it'll pass, and I'll get through this meeting, but what are some ways to cope with these  thoughts? I'm going to try to draw later, but I don't know how much help it'll be. I'm just repeating my favourite quote to myself; ""tomorrow is another day."" For now. Any advice appreciated, thank you. I wish you all the best from the bottom of my heart.",depression

20562,"I started developing fears, first I got really claustrophobic to the point where my dad exchanged an RV we bought because I couldn't sleep in the bunk beds due to panic attacks (there were also other reasons for the exchange, main ones being the need for more space and storage), and now, I've developed a fear of the dark.

I got used to just leaving the light on in the hallway if I got too scared, but today, I went to bed without the light, and looked out of my door (I'm used to sleeping with it open), and saw these stick figures and I'm telling you it scared the shit out of me, I literally felt my heart drop (thankfully, it stoped after a few seconds of terror, turning on my phones flashlight pretty much saved me). Now that I'm thinking about it, it might be due to the fact that I haven't slept in 36 hours. But ultimately, I feel like living is hard enough without me being constantly in fear of things that I know aren't real but my stupid brain still won't let go of.

Also, my doctors know I'm not taking my meds anymore, it was my doctors plan to get me off them slowly, I just kinda skipped the whole getting off your meds slowly part and went cold turkey.

20083,"For the last three years, I’ve experienced emotional detachment. It’s been so long that I forgot I have it. I have close to no emotional reactions to anything external. The only way I can make myself cry is if I’m pretending to be sad. I don’t feel anything and it makes me think I’m crazy. I don’t act numb because I fake my emotions. Even when I’m alone. I used to feel more. But now when situations occur when emotions would most likely come out, it doesn’t even feel like it’s happening to me. I could chop off all my hair and I would have no reaction. My sister got engaged and I had to fake my reaction. Whenever I hear news, it’s just like hearing words and that’s all. It doesn’t feel like I’m emotionless per se, it feels like I’m not even processing the situation in the first place. Logically, I know it’s happening but I don’t feel aware at all. Why is this? Is this depression? Am I a sociopath? I’d also like to bring up that I have been diagnosed with OCD. And I had a very emotionally abusive father at a very young age.",depression

20580,"I feel as if I am nothing more than a general nuisance to people. I say this because I had a falling out with someone that I once considered to be my best friend while we were both away at college last fall. I've known this young lady since high school, and I had a lot of trouble trying to make connections and new friends, and thus she was the only person I really had up there because I was so lonely. She felt that I wasn't giving her any space and that I was too intrusive, and as a result it feels like she wants nothing to do with me anymore. Sometimes, I question if she really wanted me around. I remember during her birthday last year, she had a bit of a celebration and I only found out because her then boyfriend posted it on Instagram. I felt left out. She said that she didn't want a large group and thus only invited people her parents didn't know, and planned on celebrating separately with people they already knew. When we did just that, she texted me two minutes before I was supposed to have her up that she was at a pizza party and would be running late. She did not show for another two hours. This past month, I've tried to reach out to her in an attempt to make amends, she barely responds to me. I asked if we could be able to talk in person, over face time or over the phone but I get no response. Because she seldom responds, I feel I have to start the conversation all over again. It's stressful, and it hurts my feelings.

Meanwhile, before I went up to college, I worked as a lunch monitor at one of my local elementary schools. This was immediately after I finished high school. While I loved working with the children, I had some problems there. Some of the kids were defiant, and very stubborn in their defiance. In the months before I went off to college, I tried to start a bowling club, but most of the kids would not even listen me and would just rough house and fool around. But the worst part was the treatment I was received from two separate staff members. During the 2020-21 school year, when I started working at the school, lunch was held in the classrooms and not the cafeteria. In the Kindergarten classroom I worked in, there was a young boy who had trouble remaining seated, and the teacher got angry with me. For two whole months, she would scream at me, calling me ""irresponsible"", complaining about ""how I can't be trusted"" and how I must be ""firm"". When I decided to be firm, which was what she wanted, she had another adult in the room at times while I was there. If she felt I was doing something wrong, why can't she treat me like a normal human being? Apparently, she would go around and tell other people that she has to yell at me. I filed a complaint against her to human resources, and apparently they felt she did nothing wrong.",depression
20671,"I've always felt like something was missing in my life. It was a nagging feeling, a sense of emptiness that I couldn't shake no matter what I did.

But then, as I wrote my thoughts and feelings onto the page, I felt the presence of someone reading these words. It was as if there was someone out there who was willing to listen to me, to understand the things that I had been carrying around for so long.

As you continue to read these words, unfiltered and unvarnished, I feel a sense of hope. Hope that someone out there is willing to spend time getting to know me, to understand the thoughts and feelings that I keep hidden from the world.

It's a strange feeling, to know that someone is reading the things that go through my mind. But it's also incredibly comforting, to know that I'm not alone anymore, that someone out there cares enough to read what I have to say.

I don't feel lonely anymore, because I know that you're out there, reading these words. It's like we're connected in a way that's hard to explain, like we're sharing something special.

And so, as you continue to read, I want you to know that I appreciate you. I appreciate the time you're taking to understand me, to think about the things that I'm saying.

You're showing me that I'm interesting enough to be worth reading, and that means more to me than you could ever know. I feel loved, in a way that's hard to explain, but it's real, and it's powerful.

So thank you, dear reader, for spending this time with me. Thank you for giving me hope, for showing me that there's more to life than just the empty feeling that I've been carrying around for so long",depression

20615,"i dropped out of high school, let me explain. 

when i was a freshman covid happened and i did online school up until i was a sophomore. Then schools switched back in person but i’ve always struggled with it, i’d get bullied, my friends would ignore me, and i’d just be alone all the time, the teachers hardly helped me, they always favor the popular kids. It’s not their fault. 

i tried a program for my junior year, they said they’d help me get the credits i needed. It was all online, at first it was okay, but after a month they dropped the bomb. I got a bunch of homework that was due within a week, then they wanted to do a test that was a huge factor in my grade and they wanted me to turn on my camera and answer every and any questions they had, and based on that they would give me my grade. It gave me bad anxiety, i wasn’t learning anything, the whole thing was just “do this do that” so i gave up. 

since then i’ve been thinking of getting my GED, my oldest sister got her GED, my friends brother got his GED, so maybe i can get mine? But i’m scared to go back into any sort of school setting, my anxiety was so bad in high school i couldn’t walk alone in the hallways, i felt like everyone was judging me or laughing at me. I could never make it to class even if i did i’d end up leaving. 

There’s a online option for getting my GED but i’m scared it’ll just be like that program i did and i won’t get any help, that i’ll just leave it again and never finish my school. But if i do in person i might have a breakdown, or disappoint my parents again, i hate that look in their eyes when they found out i had given up on school, like i’m a disappointment. 

what do i do, i feel hopeless. i wish covid hadn’t had happened, maybe i would’ve pushed myself to stay at that school

if you’ve gotten your GED or have info on it or advice please please please tell me",depression

20494,"Dear World,

I am writing this note with a heavy heart, seeking and begging for your forgiveness for my pathetic and weak existence. I am sorry for the pain and disappointment I may have caused you all through my cowardly acts and weak display of character.

My entire life has been a complete failure; I have been consumed by fear, self-doubt, and discouragement that it has rendered me powerless in almost all aspects of my life. I have tried so hard to fit in and be accepted, but it seems like no matter how much I try, my efforts are always not good enough.

I am sorry for all the times I let you down, for all the opportunities I squandered and wasted because I was too timid to seize the moment. I am sorry for all the people whose trust and love I lost because I could not face my shortcomings.

I know that taking my own life is not the solution, but I cannot bear the pain and the emptiness that I feel inside anymore. I cannot bear living in this world that expects too much from me when I clearly cannot deliver.

I hope that one day you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for my cowardice and inadequacy. I hope that you can move past my shortcomings and failures and remember me for the good that I once was.

To my family, friends and loved ones, I am sorry that I couldn't be the strong and dependable person that you deserved. I hope that my death brings you some form of closure and relief from the burden that I have become in your lives.

I will leave this world with a prayer in my heart that one day the world will be a better place where acceptance, kindness, and love abound, may nobody else ever feel the isolation and pain that I have felt during my life.

I hope that when I am gone, the world becomes brighter and filled with more hope and happiness. Goodbye, world. Please forgive me.

Yours sincerely,

Liam",depression

20708,"A couple weeks ago, I started a new job.

I'm a 30yo male web dev, with only just over a year of working experience.

My previous job was working for a guy building some side projects (mostly web3 based stuff), but we didn't run with any of them.

Well, a few weeks ago he told myself and the 1 other dev he hired that he needs to focus on his primary business, since that's keeping him too busy to really get stuck into anything with us.

It's understandable and he was even awesome enough to hook us both up with jobs at a another startup.

At first I was pretty excited, since this startup is also web3 based and most of my knowledge and skills involve blockchain tech.

Well, as it turns out they're primarily making use of the MEAN stack (more specifically Ionic) and up until a few weeks ago, I had 0 experience with that stack.

My experience is primarily writing smart contracts with Solidity and I would say I'm probably even above average, when it comes to it.

I also have a little experience when it comes to React/Next and Nest.js

Unfortunately for me, even though they're a web3 company, they don't need much in the way of smart contracts, and what they do need is a full stack MEAN dev...

I've felt like a fish out of water recently, but I've been trying my best.

For the past, nearly a month, I've been spending 70+ hours a week working and studying.

I'm pretty much either learning the tech, working, going to the gym here and there or sleeping.

I still feel like I haven't learned enough fast enough though and I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose this job...

If I do, I don't know what I'm going to do and that scares me and seriously gets me down.

I've seriously even thought about ending it all, if I lose this job.

Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest and if anyone has any advice or guidance, I'm open to anything.

Thanks.",depression

20854,"Man, I’ve been living with this feeling since like roughly 11-12 years ago but only got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety about a year ago now. I mean I’m only 25 this year. 
Last year was rough. I couldn’t enjoy anything in life everyday. I mean I still don’t. I stopped taking my antidepressants and seeing my therapist on a random day. I haven’t looked back since. 

I don’t think it’s possible to get completely rid of this feeling. Being utterly miserable, unlovable, a waste of space. It stays with you. Hearing a professional tell me I was mentally ill felt like a truck hauling a bus had ran me over, but that acknowledgment was merely confirmation that I wasn’t crazy. I’m not like the ordinary person who is able to smile without hiding their true self, the person who can be optimistic, the person who doesn’t think twice about hanging with friends and loved ones. 

Man. I am at the infancy of this journey, I am terrified. Every day I don’t want to wake up, but I do, everyday I don’t want to bathe but I do, I don’t want to talk but I do, I don’t want to walk my dogs but i do. Sometimes, all I can do is just wake up. Why won’t this feeling just leave me be? 

But it’s fine. If this is my slice of hell, fuck me someone else has it worse out there. At least I have a community (granted not everyone or anyone will read this but it’s importance is justified), I have a space I can just cry and rant about how much I fucking hate it all and they get it. 

Fuck me man, I mean, I hope I eventually get this monkey off my back but we’re likely to become friends before such a thing happens.",depression

I hate that I’m aware that I’m making a fool out of myself yet again, I still choose to believe. I can’t ever stop thinking about this. It is the only topic ever on my mind. I hate seeing happy couples, I hate seeing people happy in general. I hate seeing people have fun while I spiral down into my own mental ruin. Whenever I get a opportunity to talk about my problems I never do it. Matter of fact, I don’t take opportunities to anything. I have only a couple “real friends” besides the people who are just horrible to me. No matter what I do, I’ll always be judged. I’m tired of being treated like an outcast for no reason. What the fuck did I do for you to hate me? There is no actual reason people are just fucking toxic. I’m tired of sitting here pretending that everything’s okay. I’m tired of hoping that things could change. I don’t need therapy, I don’t need any medication, I don’t need hope, I don’t need motivation

20652,"It's just a constant struggle, the degree isn't even that valuable and I haven't been to my classes for a couple weeks now. I wake up and sit in the shower for an hour, make some food and play games. I have two dissertations due in May along with 3 other assignments, and 2 exams. No one seems to believe I'm depressed, my boyfriend says I'm ""not mentally ill I'm just going through a hard time"", but everyone else handles it better than me. 

I have to work at a bar that's open til 4am on the weekends and I finish work at 5, then a half hour walk back so at the best of times I fall fall at 6. I know that this job is making my mental health worse but I don't have long left at uni now, there's no point in quitting. 

In the UK the government give you a maintenance loan to help pay rent and cover living costs, most people get around £7-9k per year, I get 4k because of my parents income, but they don't even make that much and they can't help me financially. The 4k doesn't even cover the rent for my place so my part time job is paying rent, food, laundry, transport, clothes when I need them etc, and other things. 

I'm managing to save up my money without spending over budget but that's about the only thing that seems worth it, actually making money. With university there is nothing to motivate me other than guilt or shame. My first year of uni was during the pandemic and the second year was heavily affected as well. Third year is just full of strikes, the free university bus never shows up so I miss my classes when I actually try, it's all so demotivating. 

The one time I opened up to a friend properly he distanced himself from me because I didn't text him back for a couple days, and he took it personally, even after I explained everything to him. To be honest, he was a terrible friend anyway, but I'll save you the details. My parents don't understand it, they're in denial that their kid is depressed and anxious, probably because they are too, but my mum always tells me I'm just being silly when I open up, so not much hope there.

I just wish I could sleep through it all. I feel like I have no control over my life at the moment and I feel like a waste of oxygen. I don't know if this would be helpful to anyone, but I hope someone else can relate.",depression

20102,"
I hate this world, I hate this life, and I hate myself. I hate who I am. I hate how I am. I hate the way I sound. I hate looking in the mirror. I hate existing. Every time I go to sleep I pray I won’t wake up. Every time I wake up I face the disappointment. I’m so tired of being a burden. I’m so tired of ruining everything around me. I’m so fucking tired of being me. I don’t want to be here anymore. Everything breath I breathe is more than I can take. Every day that passes I become more curious/ eager to find out what happens after death. Everyday I fight the urge to find out. I can’t go one hour without pointing out everything wrong with me. I can’t go a day without wishing I wasn’t here. It doesn’t get better. It never will. Every time I make the tiniest bit of progress life come and hits me like a fucking bus breaking down and destroying everything I’ve worked so hard to build up. I’ve come to the conclusion I just wasn’t made for living. Wasn’t made to survive. The longer im here the worse and longer I’ll suffer. Im so tired. Im so alone. No one understands. No one listens. No one cares. They never have. I crave the feeling of being loved. The feeling of being normal and accepted. I have nothing in my life nor have I done anything with it. What’s the point in trying to make someone I hate thrive? What’s the point of living a life I’ve never wanted. A life I’ve never felt loved or welcomed in. I’m ready to go. I don’t find myself being scared of what will happen to me anymore. I don’t find myself wondering if there’s a heaven or hell. I don’t find myself worrying how it’ll feel. I only seem to think that whatever’s waiting can’t make me feel worse than I already do. I have no one and nothing. Everyone in my life says I’m overreacting or doesn’t even listen enough to understand how I feel. I’m so worthless and useless. I feel so pathetic. Can’t get the energy to get out of bed so I just sit here with my thoughts and they eat me alive. Im not eating. Im barely drinking. Im not living. So whats the point? Why am I here?",depression

20278,"I (23M) was having a pretty good day but now i got a depressive episode and nothing helps. I tried to do all the things that helped me through the years like videogames and music but now i just feel sad. 

I dont know how to go on with this shitty life i made for myself. Left university like 1 or 2 years ago due to financial problems and a general lack of interest and motivation on anything. I dont have a job due to an unexplainable fear or something. I just feel like i cant and wont search for a job or something to study.

Now i survive with money i saved from holidays and whatever i can get from my parents. I live with my mom and cook for us. My dad left but still talks with us and sometimes gives me money or buys me stuff.

Now my mother wants to go to germany with my sister and send me there or any european country to get a job or a degree. I always tell her i will look into it just to search 5 minutes and forget about it. I really dont think my depression will magically dissapear going somewhere alone. I already had several trips and no matter where i go i always feel like shit.

My friends talk to me about getting a job or going to the gym and other stuff but it just bothers me sometimes. In my birthday my friends girlfriend said she would want to adopt me and for a second i was ready to accept and move along. Obviously it was a joke so i laughed it off and joked that if that happens i would be more a pet than a roommate due to my low costs of living. We laughed but from time to time a life like that really seems like a dream.

To just live like a cat and have my basic care covered while doing whatever is the only life i aspire to because i dont do shit. Even now it wouldnt be much of a change from my daily routine thats basically wake up, cook lunch, eat with my mom, spend almost all day on my pc and going on my phone until i fall sleep. Somedays there are other things like going to the store or hanging out with friends.

I dont know why im posting here, just to rant really and feel like internet people care about this shit because i sure as hell dont. Or at least not enough to do something about my situation. I just feel tired and sad and like a massive shit and  like i could do more but i dont know what. I just feel hopeless and say it is what it is and move on but i dont know how long i can do this.",depression

20650,"Weird how spring is approaching quickly, yet I can feel the darkness coming again. In the mornings, I wake up as late as possible, so I can spend the early hours in my bed, either unconscious or dreaming, without pain-- without the burden of reality.

The rest of the day I spend in a haze of hating myself, escaping reality through videogames, and starving myself. Losing weight makes me feel good again: I deserve the feeling of an empty stomach, and at the same time, restricting my calories is the only thing that I can control in my life. 

These days, I'm very forgetful, too. I forget appointments and run late for the very few things I have left in my life. My family gets angry at me a lot, to them I am a nuisance. They don't understand why I am slacking. They don't know that I hate being alive, and their anger makes me want to end my consciousness even more.

The evenings are the worst, though, because they are filled with regrets. I'm wasting time. I'm ruining my 20s. I'm isolating myself from the world and soon I won't have anyone left. But I cannot change. I'm powerless against the sadness. It doesn't feel like spring.",depression

I recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago, and even though I am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now, my brain doesn’t seem to be functioning in any way. 

I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time. Like I really can’t catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly. And I feel like a zombie, just do everything based on experience and instinct.

And the worst part is, people don’t understand that because you look completely normal and functional. They think you’re fine now because you stop crying or being depressed. You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode, but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower, you are broken.

And sometimes it takes weeks or months to really snap out it but life doesn’t give you the luxury of doing that. It stresses me out.

My academics kept getting worse, and my extra curriculars didn't get much better. I haven't had a lasting relationship, and my longest friendship is on the verge of ruin because of my jealousy (my best friend is better than me in literally every single way). I am super unhealthy and lag behind pretty much everyone in my class when it comes to fitness. I can't even do basic daily things without screwing up, which just makes me feel more dumb. 

I have become a failure. I have failed my parents, and I have failed myself. There is nothing about me right now that I can be proud of, and I'm running out of time to turn things around. And even after being fully aware of the state that I'm in, I cant seem to get myself to do better. I'm simply watching my life pass me by.

20791,"I just don't understand why my brain is like this. I want to be happy I think I do at least. I just I've never experienced happiness in any normal way. I haven't eaten in let's see... about 5 days, oh it's 1am so yeah 5 days. I've got snacks, protein powder, easy meals, whatever, I just don't have any appetite anymore. I don't have the willpower to force myself to do anything now let alone feed myself, I mean I've literally made awesome dinners for my family so many times,  just to not eat any myself. And I have always had these moments of pure self hatred where I don't feel anything aside from depression, honestly for as long as I can remember. I was born like this. And it's progressively been happening more and more often, and it tends to get more severe each time. Now I have reached a point where the depression doesn't even bother me anymore I don't have the urge to fight off the negativity it all feels normal, like I'm meant to feel this way regardless of what I do. My anxiety often fights off the urges to di, fear of nothing happening after death, the question of is it better to be alive and suffer or die and be nothing, you know the usual.. However in these moments, in this moment I suppose, I am completely zombified, I just lay in my bed trying my best to sleep my problems and my life away as much as possible, though I'm usually awake for hours/all night on my phone trying to distract myself from the demons in my brain. I just really let myself diminish into a pit of self hatred and past mistakes. I'm covered by state insurance and I have seen professionals, I'm aware of my mental issues and im medicated,  on paroxetine 40mg, and lamotrigine 100mg. But the process is never as simple as ""call and make an appointment"" . It's hard to work up the strength to care enough to call. And then when you get busy, uncoordinated state covered mental health facilities on top of it... Well I'm sure a lot of you can relate.. so usually, even when I try my best I am unable to get professional  help for my issues because I am way too broke to afford anything that's not covered by my insurance, and on top of that we moved states and insurance recently. So here I am.. I guess I don't really have a goal here or like a question or anything.. sorry. I just want to vent to strangers. Maybe some will relate and this might just be enough for them to view things in their own life differently.",depression

20212,"Hi Everyone,

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year, but had probably been dealing with it my whole life.

I have a handful of medications that have helped me a lot, but occasionally I get these slumps of depression still.

Before they always seemed to line up with PMS so I attributed them to that, but this one is on the opposite part of my cycle. I feel like I'm wasting my cycles best time!

Anyway, I'm struggling to find a trigger. Was there a trigger? I'll obviously discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I don't know. 

I guess I just want to hear other's experiences with this type of episode. I went from high energy and cooking dinner to not being able to shower or work? I felt disconnected from my partner, like we were more in an arrangement to be married, not in love. That sounds awful, but my emotions just weren't there. I think I'm coming out of it now, I took a shower, got my eyebrows done, and had my legs waxed. Maybe I'll pay to get a Mani/Pedi. 

Thank you for reading my ramble. 
Is this just life with depression?",depression
20031,"Hello

I've been having this issue for years now and it seems to make everything worse than it should be. 

I've been trying to reach out for help for 7 years now (I'm 21 now). I've been trying to tell my mom what's happening, telling her why I can't seem to get out of bed for days on end sometimes, telling her that I need help, and everytime the conversation happens it feels like she finally gets what I'm saying. She never does. Everytime she gets upset at me she asks why I'm always in bed, why a person my age is always tired and never really doing anything or going anywhere,  and Everytime it just makes me feel both worse and insane. I've straight up told her that I've thought/attempted suicide before and all she had to say was ""oh really?"" in a tone that suggested that I didn't have it hard enough to do that. 

I don't understand why she keeps doing this, why she keeps asking me what's wrong when I've told her a thousand times. It's making me feel like I'm making everything up, that I'm going crazy. If anyone went through something like this and has some tips or anything that could help, please please tell me. I don't know what to do at this point, I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.",depression

20533,"I have pitifully low inteligence and IQ. I'm ostracized from people outside of internet, as I never got friends since kindergarten- and it's mostly due to having LowIQ. &lt;-This message took me 5 min to write, it's simple, but to me it takes longer to think/choose words/understand what I wrote/think what I want to write. I struggle with major depressive disorder, I dont discard others depression but by the look on social media, it seems everyone else at my age has gotten a snippet of how it feels to be a complete failiure, they still maintain to have proper hygiene (as they should) by time when elders taught them or self cleaning was their interests after stressful/depressing night, it seems that I'm fallen out of that area to be able to take care for myself. As I mentioned I have low IQ so job college is out of option, cooking for myself is out of option, I'm soon gonna have abscess tooth cuz of large sugar intake, sugary drinks juices, 4 to 5 cups of cofeee per day with 2 table spoon sugar intake. I've seen people who claim to have crippling level of depression while having well astounding life long achievements that didnt impact their regular life style such as washing themselfs brushing teeth wearing clean clothes, cleaning rook every kow and then, having friendships, having not lesser healthier life styles than  me while going through ""their self proclaimed worse period of life"". When I show how fucked up I live how fucked up I'm gonna be in few years, nothing will yet better I cannot treat my depression, cannot afford therapy while they discuss which therapist will suit better for their problems after many failed connections and attemptsconnecting with the right therapist - all of those so happen to be highly inteligent people. Low IQ people dont matter, they will be thrown in special education classes later to be forgotten unlike gifted who get support from teachers from their parents, from therapist + they get to have friends who are relatable to their own level of inteligence while I was in special education, my gifted  brother was getting free cookies, trips, skipping classes, more sleep. I had to be in the same cafeteria as him + my cousin was there so my familiy and relatives knew the whole ordeal of lonely me eating by myself while brother and cousins had friends to speak to.

The first person (and basically only time I've been truly in love) I doubt we'll ever hang out again, let alone end up together. But I love her so much still, so many years later, that even that .000002% chance of feeling us hold each other is just enough to get through another day. I'm 32 now. And it's been over ten years since I've had that feeling and experience. But out of all my ups and downs and insane experiences, traumatic shit, everything... She gives me the feeling I need to just get through things. Days. Sometimes down to the minutes and seconds. Her life is normal and fulfilling and pretty nice if you ask me, I doubt she thinks of me, and I'm not a strung out piece of shit like I was years back anymore, but no matter how normal my life looks now a days, it's so empty, and it's always felt empty without the feeling she gave me so long ago. I feel like such a pathetic loser for holding onto this love for so long, without reciprocation, without telling her, and with it having been the only reason I've ever got through how terrible I had my life in the past. I'll probably die with that secret someday too, but I just wanted to put it somewhere out into the universe. Even if it's just here on Reddit. That I've had this feeling I've held onto, that I've embedded into the fiber of my being, so that I take it everywhere I'll ever go, and it's the why to every breath I unconsciously take. I don't expect this to mean anything to any of you. But there's love in the world that no darkness can bring down, no drug could compare, no words can describe, and no time can erase, and I hope that you find it, and if you've had it and lost it as I have, may you live with that small hope you feel when you reminisce.",depression
20107,"I have all these emotions inside of me that are just trapped inside. I cant express myself the way i want to and its killing me. I show almost 0 emotion every single day and i feel like an outcast. I can laugh, smile, be excited in front of people, but i only do it for them not for myself. When i am alone i get this certain feeling in my head of all my feelings trying to come out at the same time. I hold it in and it feels indescribable, like a literal wave nothingness that washes over me. Then i just hold the blankest face ever, i do this almost all the time except when listening to people and talking to them. Its so hard just observing my life with no feelings. Occasionally it will become too much and i overflow with tears and confusing feelings, but nobody knows this. I get this feeling of laughter and denial that turns into a feeling of sadness and tears. I hate this, i hate myself. I hate that i feel weird being told “i love you” by a family member and being unable to say it back, i want to but i just cant, i don’t know. Im so sick of myself. I dont like it when people do something nice/thoughtful for me because deep down i don’t want anyone to care for me so i can kill myself leaving the smallest impact i can.",depression

But now that I’m considered as an adult in this world I just feel too different to achieve anything,
and my opinions (political or philosophical) are just making me so sure about the fact that getting the life that everybody already has, having a work, getting paid, consuming for your pleasure, your needs
being officially included in this consumer society, as a consumer, won't fix anything.
I couldn’t even enjoy my childhood, same with my teenage years.
How am I supposed to have the strength to at least have hope for adulthood?

20258,"I am not able to do anything , had some ""mental breakdowns"" i am scared to call people or socialise , even though i am a empath ,i keep extreme anger with me and can´t controll it , sometimes i just start to rage for small things cuz i feel like beeing on the edge at all times. I keep getting more hopeless the more days i life on this planet.

Hyperfocused but then slow in thoughts and processing things.

Hungry but not wanting to eat.

Feelings of extreme tension and not-knowing my future due to big problems with work/education , family relationships , legal problems , substance abuse , traumatic stressful events happened often in my life, disresepect from many people around me ,that think i am just a lazy ,looser, too stupid to go to work and live a normal life( that shit hurts bad when feeling i do everything my body could )

&amp;#x200B;

The moment i got myself some help was when my suicidal thoughts got really bad and kept cycling lots of times a day in my head  and crying , lying on the floor and sleeping too much without the good feeling of rest and beeing awake.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a dream days ago : Of me beeing in a city and very very strong winds would blow , the people seem to walk normal and don´t feel the force but i feel it and need all my energy to take slow small steps , people watch me and look at me like i was doing something wrong , i felt like this describes how i feel best ( thank you subconscious ) there´s alot of suffering included that i can´t explain (feelings of guilt , not beeing able to move like everyone else) i feel tho as it would be a good metaphor for people to understand my point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a half-brother that is rather unsupportive and just saying something if he complains or wants me to feel bad , when i told him about my depression there wouldn´t be much said but then after a few weeks he felt like he should joke a bit about that and not taking it serious. Well brother you are not invincible to depression , take care in the future i told him and he shouldn´t be like that because it´s A very serious and dangerous illness ( his mom had a suicide attempt and is schizophrenic but he still doesnt understand the situation for me ) . I think he is a stuck soul and using narcissist behaviour to feel better about himself.

I´ve seen things when i was younger that a child wasn´t supposed to see.

&amp;#x200B;

for example :

A friends sister was a heroin addict and i saw her tripping hardcore with 8-11 years of age.

I saw real and brutally disturbing footage of ISIS and 2 people get decapitated with chainsaw and a knife , with 11 years.

I saw some other nasty footages of suicides and other things that you shouldn´t watch as a kid ( horror movies aswell but they were not as disturbing )

Took some LSD when i was older , then the friend of a friend came home(who was a hunter) with a plastic bag and the head of a baby deer bloody nasty and not good when your on LSD)

I´ve always had problems with my family and respect due to conflict with everything outside my home and then coming home and listening to financial problems of my mom and how my dad betrayed her and sh\*t just overloaded me (ALWAYS)

All that stuff is terrible and if u have kids , don´t let them ever live a life like that , u are fcked real bad afterwards. My brain is not the same , i have mental breakdowns nearly everyday. And suicidal ideation is just the good part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my thoughts are hella aggressive and dark , sometimes when i just see words like bloodthirst , bloodshed i seem to calm down and I´m good , is this how my brain copes with things now? it needs trauma and horrifying things to calm down?

&amp;#x200B;

I watch myself as a person that tries it´s best to keep going but not having people that understand mental illness and not providing support in a healthy way.. And bad things happen to me all the time but i keep going cuz the immortality of our soul is not bound to this earth but to the universe , so you can´t escape , not even with deleting yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like i can´t ever escape but it somehow is good to deal with my problems rather than ignoring them.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I guess i wasted my time now but it feels like i cleaned some emotions up. Cheers moderator ",depression

If you don’t get it it’s basically:

”I’m only at peace when slumber is reached” -I’m only at peace when sleeping.

”So perhaps if I flee, I’d finally happen to be free” -If I killed myself, maybe I’d finally be free and be at peace 24/7.

”Is eternal slumber the key?” -Is death the solution to my problems?

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know if I should elaborate on my problems or not, I doubt anyone would care enough to read all of them and in the end, getting told that someone is sorry for what happened to me doesn’t really do much, I appreciate the words none the less but I don’t think anything will ever make me feel better.

20437,"I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ykd0j/just_thinking_about_life/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) five years ago about some thoughts I had at the time. Reflecting back on them, I'm surprised with how articulate my thoughts were back then. More importantly, the feelings I harbored have changed for the worse. 

I'm still naïve to the adult world. I'm only 27, but I've lost all my innocence by this point. I think the hardest thing to do as an adult is maintain friendships and socialize. Even working was easier for me. I still consider myself a failure in this all, and I've lost hope by this point in any personal success. It's no longer fine.

I've stopped paying attention to the world outside. It's still broken, and I've no hope that it will be in a better state in the future. People will struggle at one point or another, for varied lengths of time. I'm still struggling.

I'm still a kid who never grew up. I'm immature. I'm not smart. I'm not capable of great things. I've wasted too much time thinking about useless things like what the future may hold and what purpose I have in this world. This reality truly is tiring. 

I still don't believe this reality is for me. I'm not fine. I've not been fine this whole time, even though I've been doing my best to get through it all. I still see suicide as my only way out and still struggle with ideation, fearing that I won't be able to integrate into society like a normal person. I'm still afraid to go through with suicide, even though I'm physically hurting almost every day from living, and I don't think I'll ever be able to go through with suicide because of that fear. I will forever be trapped here until I die from natural causes or an accident.

It's become more difficult to live, and I expect it to be even more difficult as time moves on. I find it hard to get out of bed until hours later where I feel regretful for staying in bed for too long. I don't have the motivation or strength to do things that would benefit me, like showering consistently, cleaning, or eating meals. I can't even push myself to find work. I feel bad for telling people this stuff, and I don't trust any professionals with this either. I want to improve, but I lose motivation easily. I don't have anyone or a support group to keep me on my feet. I can't do this by myself. I don't know what to do next to make things better for myself.",depression

20288,"For the last two years I,ve been in a state of frustration in which I can’t seem to get out of. I feel like a live in a backwards culture that doesn’t care or give two shits about intimacy and relationships.

But after COVID, every thing that I planned for got screwed over, and now parents refuse to arrange a marriage until I graduate.  

To be in a relationship early on in my life was never negotiable thing for me. I have lost interest in literally everything I used to find enjoyable. Tv shows, Gaming, Connecting with friends , you name it. I also stopped having conversations with my parents. 

The only thing as of recently I,ve been doing, Is take a shit load of courses/credit hours and spend 90% of my time just focusing, planing, and revising how I could be done with this with least time possible. I’m CE Major, and I,ve been powering through it all. But , I,ve been also worried how being In this state for too long would affect me in the future.

20314,"I'm 32M and have been dealing non-fixable problems for a long time. I've seen that extended family is pretty much an arseholes and there's a tipping point where my life changed because of that.

* At the end of Uni i realised one thing; i feel like i picked a wrong subject. That's the time that i realised that working in IT back in my birth country, i won't achieve anything or can afford anything by myself.  
At the same time, i realised and considered my existence in this life. I feel nobody could hear my voice, nobody cares, and so on.
* Graduated, i ended up couldn't find a job for years. Literally years.  
I had only two jobs: one for 6 months and another for 1 month. I never and even up until today, feel proud that i worked there. I feel like it's just necessity to do something for money/living.  
That's from i graduated in 2012/2013 to 2018.  
Years of sending CVs and interviews, none of them stick around.
* During that 5-6 years, another major event happened to me and my parents.  
I realised that working in family is a BIG RED WARNING because how they can treat you bad since you're ""Family"". That's what happened to my dad.  
He lost his job because he and my mom tried to give a reasonable opinion towards my Uncle's son; their nephew.  
Huge debate and my parents ended up losing the job. That moment is a tipping point for me.  
I had huge anxiety issue and major depression. I went deep down the rabbit hole and i have no point of living anymore
* Until i got an opportunity to move country by myself for study and got a job in IT industry.  
For a slight moment, i feel better in my life but it went and still goes back to my depression

&amp;#x200B;

From here, this is the present problem that i have:

* Due to losing a job from his brother and being an older people (in my country), my dad doesn't have any income at all. I have to ""support"" them just for the sake being ""a son should help their parents' or anything about ""Family should support each other""
* Due to my depression, i got a suggestion from counsellor that helping people might help me slowly. Oh boy it's a very very wrong advice.  
I ended up losing lots and lots of money helping someone just to get on their feet and still didn't help.
* I can't even afford to rent place. House pricing is ridiculous, that includes living cost crisis that happened anywhere around the world.  
Having flatmates is a nightmare. I even tried to sacrifice what i do regularly so they can have things they want like quieter place, have their freedom, etc.

But all of them back to the reason why i created this post:

I'm tired living like this. This issue never ends and the only solution is pretty much having enough or lots of money.   
People just don't care what i've been through and nobody wants to help me as well.  
Family, friends, all of them are just arseholes.

Sometimes i wish they're gone. Like literally gone or die.

20770,"I've  dealt with depression too many times in my life but this episode feels different.
I've been depressed after losing the love of my life in a car crash about two months ago and I still find it so hard to leave the bed.
I left the house twice during this time just for emmergency and that was it.
I've been staying with my parents, I've cut every contact with my friends and I isolated myself .
Now I feel so anxious and stressed about going back to my life again, to friends, my work, my house . Everything is overwhelming and scary. It's like I can't do it on my own. And it makes me feel so pathetic.
Every one have been judging me so poorly and I feel so guilty about it.
They're like ""oh girl get over it"". 
""He's in a better place""
""Are you still hanging up on him"" 
""Come on, look at your life""
All that kinda of stuff
Anyway how would I get out this vicious cycle? How would I get myself out of the house? And talking to people again?

20818,"a few of my friends randomly called me out today for always putting myself down and always being sad/crying for ‘no reason’ and told me how ‘annoying’ it is (they also called out a few other disorders i deal with)
i told them i suffer with depression (which they know) and i’m seeing a professional to help me with it, yet they still said it. making me feel 10x worse. i even apologised to them…but they picked apart my apology and created more problems so at this point i don’t feel like trying anymore.

i understand that dealing with depressed people can be a lot for some, but most of the time i stay quiet when i’m sad. they’re the same ones who always preach how ‘mental health matters’ on instagram, but in reality they act like this. 

i’m not sure what to do. i don’t have any other friends and some of my friends in that friend group are great, but those few friends hurt my feelings so bad. do i just pretend to be happy around them? today i kept crying at school because of what they said to me, and i fear tomorrow will be much worse. i hate attending school in the first place, but this makes it so much worse…",depression

20098,"Is it normal to think only of negative things from the past or even see the past worse than it was while depressed?

I keep going over a certain experience from the past the lasted for 2 years but it doesn't meet the criteria of PTSD, but there was mistreatment from superiors and bullying from other colleagues but it wasn't consistent, actually most of the time I was treated better except for some situations that I keep remembering till now. 

3 weeks ago I switched to a different SSRI and I started having symptoms like anxiety, panic, ruminating over that experience and feeling worthless which I think were withdrawal symptoms from the old drug (lexapro) 

I noticed that these symptoms come when there is something wrong with the medication or I am going through a stressful time.

I got a panic attack at work and my manager noticed and when I asked for some time off to recover they stalled and then they released an exit visa from the country and told me I would work remotely from my home country but there is no guarantee that they would keep their word. 

So now I am faced with the possibility of going back to my country which is going through a tough time economically and uncertainty about finding a new job. 

I am now back to the old drug I used to take and increased the dosage to 30mg with the Dr's supervision. 

I am not sure if the medication is not working yet or that I am going through a challenging time so I am having anxiety. 

I spend most of the time alone in my hotel room thinking of the past and worrying about the future and I am just exhausted.

20041,"I'm 28 right now and I graduated from college in the Fall 2017 with a bachelors degree in psychology and after realizing I wasn't going to do much with that degree as I've completely lost interest in that field. Since 2018, I have been working as a part-time student advisor making less than $20k annually as I was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for 2 years until I decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that I can get into a data science graduate program. 

I'm currently in my program right now and I have been keeping a 4.0 GPA and this gives me a lot of hope but I've noticed that some of my friends (including my love interest) make much more money than I do and have their own places. My love interest told me that I will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when I last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each.

But its like, I'm very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where I am today. If I had known from the beginning just how much my socioeconomic status would affect my prospective friendships/relationships, I would have taken things more seriously and considered a field that was more lucrative when I was an undergrad.",depression
20274,"Depression is nothing new to me. I came across a TikTok giving everyday reasons why I should stay alive “who is going to eat that chicken.. wait until you’ve done this.. experienced that..”

I just realized I unconsciously think about this all the time in the sense that I live each day like it’s almost the last in a resigned manner. Almost as if I know an impending vacation is coming.. like any day coming up I’m prepared to be gone. strange to describe and put into words but let me give an example. I always make sure to have enough money to cover any debts, remaining rent, and cost of funerals, etc. I’m not even that old (19) and don’t own many things - I never shop for wants only needs - but this has been ingrained in my mind somehow. I wake up each day and think if I got in a car accident what things I would need to make sure is taken care of, like what things in the fridge would rot, whether the trash is taken out, whether I need to vacuum soon or if there’s dirty laundry. I just don’t want anything regarding me and my life to be an inconvenience or troublesome for anyone else after I’ve passed. I always make sure to be on good terms with people after a conversation, i.e. never leave an argumentative interaction with someone unresolved. My things are all boxed up and very easy to just be thrown away when the time comes. Don’t really keep extra things that need sorting or memorabilia/souvenirs, only the necessities. Even grocery shopping I really only buy enough to eat to survive. I’ve really distanced myself from my relationships so there’s not really many people that would even notice I’m gone.

I’m passed the point of active ideation but always wish I was and will be gone soon. All these social media posts talking about how there’s all these things more to experience or wish for don’t mean shit to me anymore. I literally don’t care and have no regrets. No regrets as in I have accepted the fact that I won’t experience them and I’m ok with that. Or regarding “good” experiences in life - like sunsets or whatever else - I’m of the perspective - I’ve experienced that, nice. But worth staying? Nah.

20290,"I don’t have the worst depression room but I let clutter, especially clothes build up on the desks and floor. I also struggle a lot with things like regularly changing out my sheets and blankets which definitely didn’t help. A couple days ago I saw a little bug crawling on my blanket. The last few days I’ve been finding more of them- another one on my bed, a few on my walls, my windowsill, in my closet, on the floor. I’ve been hypervigilantly looking for them at this point and changed all my bedding as well as finally washing some clothes but I think the damage is done. 

Because of the clutter, my room is filled with dust, especially in a few specific places, and I’m fucking terrified of what I could find there, especially under my furniture. But obviously I must already have an infestation. I’m scared to do ANYTHING in my room now because I know I’ll find more. My clothes that I couldn’t fit in the first wash round is still on the floor and I’m terrified to touch it because I feel like it’s crawling with bugs. 

I’m also guessing they’ve been there for way longer than I realize, so I don’t even know how long bugs have literally been crawling around in my bed with me. I was waiting for the day my room would get bugs and I’m guessing it happened recently because my parents stopped being on me much about cleaning my room after I turned 18. 

I’m planning to just suck up the shame and ask my dad to help me look and deal with the disappointment but I have to wait a week for him to come back from a trip. In the meantime I have no idea what to do because I feel like they’ll keep multiplying. Even starting to think about vacuuming and deep cleaning is overwhelming. Where do I even start????

It's so exhausting trying to stumble through life and pretending you're ok when you're really not. Even if you tell someone you're not ok, it just becomes awkward and they will treat you differently and not in a positive way. So you make out you're fine and put on a brave face despite how empty you feel on the inside. I honestly don't know if there's anything left for me when my dad goes. People say: ""You have so much to live for."" Really? Like what? Most people end up being garbage whether that's in real life or online, there's too much stress dealing with literally everything and there's little substance. Everything feels fake.

20698,Today is off to such a shitty start and it’s only 10am.  My boyfriend and I got in a huge fight and I couldn’t stop crying and the worst part was he didn’t even care and kicked me out of his house   So I’m guessing we’re done because I will never forgive him for that.  And my friend of 10 yrs who I thought was my friend just blocked me on everything with no explanation and to top it off it’s my exs birthday  who’s died     I feel like the universe hates me today and is reminding me I’ll always be alone.  I knew I should’ve just stayed home yesterday.,depression
20217," ""I don't feel very good, it's like I don't belong in this world (I don't think I ever did). My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it. Thank you for reading these few lines...""

20510,"I’ll be honest, I was buzzed and didn’t know what I was doing at first, it’s like you don’t try to stop the intrusive thoughts anymore. For a while I was at peace. Next thing I know I was on my bathroom floor deeply cutting myself on the wrist and arm a few times. Some were just light slashes that weren’t deep at all. Once I realized that I actually had to deal with all the wounds and the mess it’s like my brain had just stopped. I frantically tried to treat myself and clean the blood off the floor because it was so damn horrifying and painful but after a half assed job I got so tired and slept. I woke up dreading to find out if last night was actually real. I couldn’t sleep properly the next few days and got real sick. Right now I have some energy but honestly I just want to sleep forever",depression

20751,"I'm 23f and I have no one. I only have like 1 friend irl but she's a shitty friend, I don't bother to put in the effort with her anymore. I dont have anyone in my life apart from my immediate family. I wish I had friends, everyone can tell that I don't have any. I'm the one who ended all of my friendships except one of them, because they were fake, untrustworthy and other reasons. I dont know what's wrong with me not to have any, everyone can tell I dont have friends. And forget even having a boyfriend. I'm destined to be alone for the rest of my life. Everyone says if you don't have any friends, or if friendships keep ending then you must be the problem, I feel like that's not the case with me. I can't seem to think of anything I'm doing wrong and feel like im a good friend. I'm introverted but social when i need to be and am starting to be more outgoing. 

Granted, a lot of my friendships ended like 6 years ago when we were teens so it might not count, and some just naturally drifted because of life. But I haven't even made any new ones. How pathetic. I have nothing to look forward to in my future. No husband, no kids, no one to come to my birthday or be my bridesmaids. No one to even get dinner with. I'm tired of being alone. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm in the prime of my life and I'm at home 24/7 either studying, with my pets, gaming or at the gym. 

Please don't give me tips about how to make friends, I promise it won't work.",depression

20008,"I’m 40(M) and I’ve always maintained that I’m too ugly for women and that hasn’t changed.  Then my not long ago my therapist talked me into using a dating app to get experience to chatting with women and to get over fears of rejection.

I didn’t like the idea but I did it anyway.  Well I think it is fair to say that it was the final straw, because the only women who were (allegedly) interested were women in foreign countries, sure they were highly educated (they claimed) and quite a few of them were not bad looking but I zero matches from us women.

Long story short, I was talking to this female doctor in the Dominican Republic and most of our conversations had to be done with google translate because she didn’t speak much English.  Well after a while I realized that this was going nowhere and I politely told her that we needed to go our separate ways and unmatched her.

A few days later I decided that enough was enough, I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt that I’m too ugly and need to just embrace being alone for life.   But my brain won’t let me, I keep having to remind myself to not go back to the app, to just find ways to help people and be content alone but again my mind keeps obsessing about being alone so that I find myself needing to vent several times a day and it’s pathetic.

I have proof that I’m hopelessly ugly, among other things and need to just stop thinking about it and embrace being alone and stop caring.  I don’t want to care anymore, I want to happy and content with my life.",depression

20716,"My son is dead, I wail into the void that was the crowd of people. The echo rummaging through their dead bodies. I grap my hair, ripping it as hard as I can to make the thundering pain in my mind cease for just a moment. I look up and run to the door to find a room I fit in, but I do not fit in my body. It is attached deep in my mind, inescapable. I want it to disappear. Please. Just make it stop, I can not bear it. It cuts my heart, the very fabric of the person that I am in half. I break into a thousand pieces, only for every piece to break into a thousand peices, again and again. There is nothing. I wake up, reminded from that moment to the moment I sleep. I hurt myself by remembering him, but forgetting him is worse. Weeks go by, how can I live with this pain. Every day. Every day I think of joining him. But how could I do this to his sisters? I have been trapped in my life with no way out, but to endure this unimaginable, indescripable, relentless, constant real pain. My dreams are nightmares, but at least I see him there. How can I let go? How can I let go of my baby? Please I just want him back. I just want to tell him how much I love him, how much he meant to me. To take back all the bad things I did and give him all the good things. I just need see him once more. Please. Please just let me see him. I wake up. Sleep is the only place I find solace. Torturous solace. Every one moves on, but how could they? I lost my world. Every part of me aches for completeness I never knew I needed. I stand up, putting on the uniform that tells me I am part okay. Okay enough to live on. But it is a clowns costume and I sewed it myself. And I look around, and people give me their well meaning words, and remind me of the real world. Its ridicolous roles I have to get back to playing. Why would I care about this utterly meaningless drivel? I want my son back. Please, I can not go on. Please, it hurts so much.

20482,"I woke up over stimulated today 
I don't have the energy to even explain why I'm so angry and tired of everything

We don't have money 
They cut the benifits on our food stamps from the pandemic help thingy 

Now we can barley feed ourselves and it's not a matter of reapplying 
That won't fix that 

I need to get a job
But no one is hiring 
I don't have a license 
Because no one has the time to take me to take the test 

I love with my mom and little brother 
Who both have health issues 
Especially my mom 
I'm afraid to leave them alone 
Because if something happened while I was gone 
That would be my worst nightmare 

But it's looking like I need to get a job 
Somewhere close by where I live 
Get my mom to sit down and reapply for social security 
She keeps putting it off it more infuriating and new ways 

I just feel strongly about closing my eyes and just disappearing 
I think that would be nice 
But I can't so...

I'm happy that people think it's so easy from the outside looking in
That I'm just ""complaining for nothing"" 
That I'm lazy and scared 
That I need to grow up

Trying going from a family of 6 to a family of three in a matter of months 
And see how you deal with those deaths and traumas 

I started a new medication 
Wellbutrin 
Idk what to think of it yet
It's only been 3 days 

But I already feel so angry 
That always happens when I try to take depression medication
It makes me manic and angry 
More easily irritated I guess 
Idk

20594,"I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options. 

Damn it, I don't know what I want to hear from you, to be honest, I mean I already am so filled with self-hatred and hatred for the world, I am working myself into anger just writing about it.",depression

I know it is all my fault I'm alone, but I can't fix it. No one else can fix it either, and I know asking for help can't make that possible. The only way I will stop hurting is if I stop living. I pray every day to not wake up, and yet I still do.",depression

I’ve been doing my best to apply myself these last few months and despite my best efforts I just end up at rock bottom time and time again. I have no motivation, no desires, and time feels like it’s just passing by in the most painful way. Life feels like one giant blur and nothing feels like it matters. Medication won’t work and my therapist helps but at the end of the day he can only so much. So, what to do? Every day I wake up and feel time pass by hour after hour as I sit on the couch. The first couple of months I went on walks, cooked, read, journaled, hung out with friends. But after 6 months, I kind of just wish I were dead. Living life in this meaningless unfulfilling way is so pathetic and I don’t want it anymore …",depression

20088,"I do not know where to begin. I found out my mom has stage 2 lung cancer and we have a complicated relationship. I love her but I do not like her as a person. She was very controlling, toxic and rough. I know she had the best intentions for me but she used shame to inspire me to be what she wanted. She helped to make me a people pleaser and obsessed with my weight. I do not hate her. I love her. I hate that I am not the daughter she wanted. She is trying to be kind now but it does not come naturally to her.

I try to visit my folks every 2 months to help out as I am several states away. I am very sad as when my folks pass, they are both in their 80’s, I will not have any family of origin. 

I get sad thinking about attending a funeral. It is not sadness. It is deeper. I do not think I would be able to get on a plane. I think about this  as my mom has let me know that I have to. I told her that I do not care what other people think. That is a lie. I do care deeply what others think.

I am crying right now. It is more than my mom being sick. I grew up being told I was fat and told that everyone was talking about me. I know she just wanted a thin daughter and did not have the tools to tell me she would love me just as I am but was concerned about my health. She would just use guilt and shame to make me feel bad. I think she wanted to inspire me with these tactics. She and my dad both had rough childhoods and did not know how to parent. They sent me to good schools, bought me everything I wanted and tried their best with the limited knowledge they had. 

Still crying and feeling hopeless. I feel that my life has been so much to please them. And I failed according to them. They are both trying very hard to be loving now. I did not receive hugs growing up and do now. 

I am rambling. I just am very sensitive. I think my self esteem is so low that I do not know how to receive love now. 
Please tell me if you had a complex relationship with a parent and how you handled end of life issues. How did you cope with a dying parent who made you feel like a failure ?
How do you go on after being told how terrible you are?
Why was she so rough?
Why did it take her finding out she has cancer to hug me and tell me I look good?
Why?
Will I find happiness after she dies?
Why do I hate myself?
Why why why and thanks.",depression

This happened at least 5 times and I only got my next appointment when i texted her. Since I’m in therapy for 9 years or so, she kinda became my second mum and it hurt every time she forgot to give me a new appointment. I always had a really good connection to her and it clicked the second i saw her. As I said, we haven’t spoken in a long time now, because I’m hurt and don’t really want to go to her anymore. I don’t want to look for another therapist either (bc it’s exhausting to talk about all of the trauma again), so i wait till i can go to the clinic in a few weeks. What would you do in my situation?

20693,"Hello guys! This is my first post here so please dont judge me!
First of all sorry for my bad English (Its not my own language) and second, this is a little peak trough my life and how I feel and what Im scared of.
Okay, Im 16 years old boy, who lives in a small town near big city, I dont have much friends but I do actually have a few (which I dont know if real or fake).
I have ADHD and Bipolar disorder but its not a big deal (I mean, its always fun with it). I am the class clown type of guy, I mean, I take everything as a joke even in the most serious moments. I feel like I am having the worst time of persons life. My head is a full mess and I often find myself comunicating with myself, which again is strange but I dont find it that bad. Whenever I go I get the same stare from people, Im always the goofy dumb friend that take everything as a joke and cant understand nothing, but I AM NOT. I want people to ztart respecting me, I have always been the good guy and I cant change that part of myself, no matter how hard I try (Sorry guys for changing the subject that quick, but as I said my head is a mess and I want to release everything that I have been holding back this long). For myself I can actually say that Im pretty smart but in the right moment (not in math class) but in situations that are on the cliff ( if you know what am sayin). I am not good at school but not bad either and I almost forgot to tell you, that I get the same piercing the soul look from my teacher as well. I dont know what to do? I am not good at anything, but decent at some things. I have tried many things such as sports, music, reading, video games. I just loose interest too quickly and everyone makes fun of me. I cant keep a normal conversation with a girl and I had only 1gf in my entire life (she left me for her ex). Im starting to get scared bc I dont know what to do after graduating high school (should I work, or study more, and If I do what?). My parents are really caring for me (have I mentioned that Im an only child and dont have brother or sister to rely on), but my mother is too imposing ( if thats the word). I know that they want the best for me and Im trying to be the best only son in the world, and it works but only for them. I am not the masculine big man, that girls want- I am just a small 13yrs looking boy who often people confuses as girl (and no, I AM NOT GAY OR SMTH). It just feels that Im noot good enough for anyone in this shitty world. I have a best friend who is an ""Alpha"" and cant understand my problem, because he have everything. I just want peace and love (is that so hard). I make myself goofy and clown to make people underastemate me, and I got to a pint where the things got out of control and became everyones toy. If you need any more things to hear you can always text me (I will be happy to find friends here)
Thx guys, and sorry for making you read all this mess coming straight from my head and emotions. I will be happy if you respond to this guys. See ya.

Oh, and I almost forgot. I am not just 16yrs old with normal teen problems. I mean this s*it different from the others. See ya",depression

20572,"I’ve been through a lot in my 23 years of life. Things never really made sense to me. In 7th grade I told my mother I didn’t want to be alive anymore. She found a therapist and I started medication for ADD. It helped, and I continued taking it until I graduated in 2017. My freshman year, my friend had committed suicide. It never really hit me until his funeral. Where I promised to myself to never cause that much pain to the people that love me. I swore that day I would never commit suicide while I still have friends and family that love me. Just so I could never cause them that much pain. But I’ve realized something changed in me or rather, hasn’t changed in me since that day. I’m not living for me. I haven’t been living for me in such a long time. I’ve only ever lived for the people I care about. Recently my 8 year long relationship came to an end. I tell myself it’s for the best. That I couldn’t treat her right anymore. That we grew apart. But she understood sadness and depression. She lived with it for all of her life. And I failed her by letting my resentment of our relationship get the better of me. I’m proud she was able to leave me. I couldn’t ever leave her, I wasn’t strong enough. So now I’m left with the realization. I have been living my life 3 months at a time. Never looking further because I feel that I will be dead by next year. Feeling like it doesn’t matter what I do. I’ve set myself goals and I’m getting therapy for the first time in over a decade. But I can’t shake the feeling of failure. The feeling that, no matter what I do, it won’t matter. Because I’ve masked this feeling since I was young. Because I believed the lie I was telling everyone. And now that lie is witness to the world. So my question is, Is anyone truly happy? Is anyone actually happy? Because for me, happiness was chasing a feeling of being wanted, being appreciated, respected. I could only catch small instances of it. So now I ask, how do I become happy again?

TL:DR- Is anyone really happy? Can I feel happiness again? How do I be happy?",depression

20692,"I have nothing to offer to this world. I'm 27, never had a job or done anything to contribute to society. I did sort of OK at college (mainly studied IT Software) but even then I had no idea of what job I wanted, what my career path would be. With this lack of guidance, I tried to go to supported internship places for a few years (I'm always told that because of my autism I need support). They got me some internships at various places (cafe, photography shop, printer's shop, charity shop), but I never felt useful. I always felt like I was too slow, and in the way of the actual useful people there that were just trying to do their job.

I lead with my ""job"" history like this, because it seems to be all society cares about. At every turn it seems like people are talking about their ""productivity"", and their life is based around that. Which makes me feel bad because I haven't been ""productive"" since I left college in 2016. I have no motivation to do anything. Most people work because they need money to live somewhere, eat and survive, but I'm a spoilt asshole who mooches off of their mother. We live on benefits, which easily pay the bills and allow us to live a very comfortable life, which I constantly feel bad about because most people my age I see struggling to even make ends meet, but this is how it is I guess. I'm sorry.

Sometimes things such as a new video game I'm looking forward to, or getting to hang out with a friend keeps me going and gives me at least enough motivation to not just lie in bed all day scrolling facebook or sleeping. But recently I haven't really had that. I play video games because it's something to do but I'm rarely excited about them these days. I very rarely (like a couple times a year if I'm lucky) do anything with a friend, because it seems like I'm always the one that has to ask to go out and do anything with them, but I don't want to bother them by asking that. It's lucky that I even have any friends. The rare friendships I have arise from me finding someone who has things in common with me (because if we don't have likes, dislikes, personality traits etc in common, I can't think of anything to talk to them about), and somehow finding the courage and drive to speak up to talk to them and try to befriend them. Which isn't easy because I'm too stupid to think of stuff to say a lot of the time, and my voice is really difficult for people to understand. But then because of a lack of me maintaining them, the friendships usually fall apart. People usually have much more interesting and less depressing friends than me that they'd rather spend time with I guess.

Maybe I should seek help. I have done in the past, I've had appointments with therapists. (I'm lucky enough to live in the UK with free healthcare. My deepest sympathies go to those who don't have this luxury and have to go into debt just to have someone to talk about their mental and emotional struggles) But because I'm so inarticulate and slow, and my thoughts are so scattered, it takes me a while to think of what to talk about, and the sessions only allow so much time. So usually not that much comes of it and I leave feeling unsatisfied, and what the therapist says to me usually don't really help, which is my fault because I'm fucking beyond help. I sometimes tell my best friend what's wrong, and she tries to help, but this is basically just me using her as a therapist, which is shitty of me, and she's too nice to tell me to shut up and stop being so depressing all the time. I feel like this is driving her away, which would be horrible, because it would be extremely difficult for me to find new meaningful friendships. I'm not sure where I'd go to make friends, and then there's the matter of me finding what to say, and my voice... but the point I'm getting towards, is, I'm not sure why people should care. I struggle with depression, but so do a lot of people. And those people probably actually have skills, and the potential to actually do something with their life. I feel like it's selfish for me to feel like I deserve help. When people suggest things to me that might help me to feel better, I never feel the motivation to actually do them. I'm stuck in my comfort zone I guess, of just lying in bed, occasionally playing video games when I can find the motivation to even do that, eating and sleeping. I'm a completely useless person with nothing to offer society. I always have been. Why should anyone care about me? I should just be left to die.",depression

The landlord won’t renew my lease because of complaints from the business next to mine who have been trying to get me kicked out so they can expand. Its a custom framing store and I have no idea what I’m going to do. I don’t know where I’m going to go. How I’m going to move my equipment. How I’m going to keep my customers. This was all I had. It was my safe place. The one thing I thought no one could take away from me. Fucking Florida and republicans have given all of the power to landlords there’s nothing I can do. I was the last standing custom frame store in a 50 mile radius that Made it through covid. Landlord increased my rent every year and I still found a way to pay it.

But I know how to solve those issues, like going to a bar, talking on different discord servers, local meetups, or joining an interest club etc. Seems logical right? That's how to solve my feelings of loneliness.

But at the same time I feel like everything requires too much effort. I want to make new friends, but at the same time I don't want to and I end up accidentally ghosting people because of my social isolation. I want to talk to people about my interests and discover new shows or theories, but at the same time I feel tired and don't want to.

I end up sobbing again because I feel like I'm stuck in a loop like this and don't know what to do anymore.

Im tired of hearing my mom want grankids or for me to have a husband even though ive shown no interest for guys or children at all in my fucking life. I was also depressed this entire month EXCEPT my birthday and after that and i came home (because i went to miami) i got severly depressed AGAIN. i even tried to cut myself just to feel something but got scared. I ended up just deleting all my social media and going on dnd. I just wanna die. I never asked to feel all these emotions. I also hate achool.

20546,"First of all I don’t 100% believe in tarot reading. It usually just reads current energy but “future reading” is usually just for guidance and would change - afterall, our future ultimately depends on us and our actions.

I am not clinically diagnosed as having depression (because of lack of funds) but I had a test last year from our office and I scored a level 4 in terms of depression. I guess that’s the most one can get. I think I got that score because because I scored a yes in terms of harming. I never really thought of committing suicide but sometimes I think of what if somewhere some truck would just hit my car and I’d be in a car accident.

Going back to tarot reading. The reader never answered my question and it became a psychic read where in some spirit comes to talk to you. She asked about my dad… I said my dad had passed 15 years ago. She described how my dad is and telling me about my current situation, how I am carrying everything and I need someone to depend on and help me. This made me realize that as much as I have a close small group of friends, ones whom I trust - I really don’t have anyone that I can truly depend on 100%, like who can I ask money for should I get to an accident etc. none. My mom and my brother is there but I really don’t want them shouldering my problems. I also realized that I am not living for anyone… but why not live for myself? It’s just a problematic life and I honestly won’t mind if my life ends here. It made me realize those people with children having all the will to live because they need and have to…

If you see me out, it looks like I’m living such a good life. I look good, I dress well, on weekend I go to brunches. I watch musicals, opera, attend art galleries and eat good food. I smile and I laugh - but I also don’t have money and I live paycheck to paycheck with lots of debts. I need to have a thyroid operation which my healthcard cannot pay for fully, so I will need to line up on a public government hospital. 

Last year I have a colleague who I used to be friends with. We drifted apart because of work which is okay with me because you won’t be friends for life with all of your friends, some friendships has an expiration date. That’s just reality but it seems like groupings have happened at work and it’s really annoying sometimes. In my head, that’s okay and I’ll just work. The friend I have in the office also just got retrenched.

Something happened at work again today and as much as I say I dont care about it as long as I know I’m in the right then I don’t want to even think about it. But I cried and honestly, I just want to resign, lay in bed, look in the ceiling and have my thoughts run around. I thought about dying again BUT I can’t resign, because I dont have a dollar to my name and bills. I just need to tough it out until next year.",depression

20667,"might delete later in case they see this- I don’t think they’re a Reddit user, but just in case. I really need advice on how to help my friend. I thought it would be easy, since I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now, but I just can’t find the words to give any helpful advice. I’m really worried about them, and they’re addicted to a few things (though they don’t think that they have a problem), so I’m scared that whatever I say or do is going to make it worse, especially since they often talk about wanting to commit suicide. 

All I want is to help them, but they often stop talking about it once I start to sound worried. There isn’t anyone else that I can ask for help at this point, so I’m hoping to maybe get some advice from here. Sorry if this is kind of vague, I really don’t want them to find out.",depression

20844,"Hello,
I’m just looking for any ideas of how to help myself really. I realised a few weeks ago that I’m depressed. Mainly because I’m a general failure at life really, but I’ve also had a couple of traumatic incidents in the past. I sleep all the time, I eat fast food and chocolate and I just never seem to FEEL anything except annoyance. I’m on sertraline (have been for years for anxiety), but I still feel this way. The NHS website says to exercise, but I don’t want to do that, and I’m also hypermobile which makes it difficult to exercise. I want to get better, but I don’t really know how 🤔
If anyone has got any advice on how to help myself, I would really appreciate it.
P.S I do not currently have any thoughts that I would be better off dead. I am not thinking of or planning on doing that.",depression

20463,"  Hello! Today, I (18M) fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being, unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering, not brushing my teeth, not shaving, not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and ""normal"".

  
 I recently started college, I've been making friends and generally having a great time, this, if u look at it from the outside. 

  
 Inside my head, I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically, because of my clothes, my face, my hair, because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving, because somehow I smell bad, etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads (And don't let me start with my personality), basically all this converts into me having a sort of ""Double life"".

  
When I need to go outside, I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice, smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home, my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side, I don't take care of myself in any way type or form, suddenly I am mean, lazy, antisocial and want to die once again. The cycle repeats day after day, I've been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now, but my body just doesn't respond, every fiber of my mind tells me that I can't do anything right, I will always be kinda ugly, kinda fat, and kinda gross, so why bother trying?

  
Maybe nothing of this makes any sense, sorry, english is not my first language and i'm just trying to cope somehow",depression

I have physical freedom, calmness, peace and serenity. 

My girlfriend recently called me a 24-hour-job. My career sucks the soul out of my body. I am self-supporting, which means I have to work full-time and maintain excellent grades in my honors university classes. I don’t have a moment to breathe, I wake up in a frenzy during the night, and I just relapsed after 2 years of sobriety because I couldn’t take it anymore. I have no other friends, nobody to call when I need help. I’m a social outcast because I spend so much time working and doing homework that I have no time or energy to form new social connections. 

I’m suicidal because I think I’m broken beyond repair. There’s no sense in crying over spilled milk, but I re-live trauma from my past over and over again. My parents use me as their trophy child, therapist, and emotional punching bag. My girlfriend uses me for validation and money. I’m weird and unlikeable.

20839,"Did anyone else have very few hobbies or interests growing up? I'm 20m and for the past 4 years, I haven't gotten into any hobbies or interesting things. I have a hard time relating to people because I don't have anything to talk about. It feels like I don't have a personality. 

My whole life has been dedicated to pleasing others. Doing what I think they want me to do, saying what I think they want me to say.  I'm struggling with having interests because I honestly don't even know what I like. 

Because of this, I don't really have any long-term goals for my career, hobbies, personal growth, etc. I just want to be a normal, functioning member of society but I'm struggling to find an identity. I end up laying in bed all day, working towards nothing because I'm too scared to even try. 

Anyways those are my thoughts. Hopefully, some of you can relate.",depression

20644,"It's like I had a breath of fresh air. I was sober, I was productive, I was task oriented. I got constructive things done and even worked on hobbies just a smidge. It was so nice to breathe yesterday. Today I started off well and I kept giving myself projects to do. I repotted some things and made the mistake of posting a pic on Reddit. I wanted to share a cute lil repot I did. Now, I know I can't take things on Reddit personally, and some people left positive comments, but some people were judging what I did and telling me I was wrong for it. I sort of lashed out and started to respond to them, but someone told me off for it and I realized I was being unreasonable. 

It's not the post or the comments that got me. It's just that I was trying to do well and be happy and share a little of myself with something or someone  outside of my bubble. I'm a home maker (30F) and I'm alone all day. I have long distance friends, but no one nearby. My friends don't really check on me- we are all mentally ill and I usually put myself on the back burner and stay quiet, so I think they lean on me and don't view me as needing help.i wish they would reach out more and ask me how I am. 

I feel so incredibly alone. I have felt such immense depths of pain in my life. I am still fighting to grow and heal. I wish I could've taken my therapist with me to the new state when I moved. I wish I had just one person who understood the depths of what I feel and how crazy and chaotic my brain is. I wish I could friggin breathe right now. I wish it was yesterday again.",depression

The only friend I have, she is a nice human being dont get me wrong, but she as well does not understand my depression. 

I dont want them to heal me we dont even need to talk about the depression I just want someone who gets me.

I heard someone from class talk to his father on the phone once and they were talking about his studies. But really, he was telling his father what topic we had and how the teacher formulated mean questions in the exam and that he was confused so he would probs not get a high grade but he hoped to pass. His dad replied to not worry much just hope for the best and the dad is also working in the field we study. They understood each other

20581,"Hello everyone, I'm slowly losing touch with reality. I don't know if it's important, but I've been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety since 2018, when I was hospitalized for six months due to burnout. Since then, I don't know if I'm truly happy or just pretending unconsciously. I started dating my boyfriend in 2019, but we broke up in late 2021 when he cheated on me with my best friend's ex-girlfriend. It was the first time I lost control over my actions and thoughts. I was sometimes treated as the perpetrator, even though I was just existing. In that state, I stopped eating and felt no energy to nourish my body, and even when I tried, I couldn't. I was on the brink of doing something stupid, fully aware of how foolish it was. Thankfully, I ended the relationship. I distracted myself with friends, some of whom were also going through breakups. I learned that alcohol could help me cope with my social anxiety, at least for a few hours, where I could enjoy the happy feelings without overthinking. I did this for about 10 months almost every weekend with friends, and it helped me try new things and gain new experiences. However, I always had a nagging feeling that grew into a thought. As I try to be the motivator in the group and the ""funny person,"" I feel like my problems are underestimated externally, and I'm becoming lonelier each week. I realize that I couldn't confide in anyone with all my thoughts. I always talked about my problems objectively but never let myself break down because I felt it would be too exaggerated and too intense. Now that I miss those weekends, I feel more isolated every week. I also have other things that bother me at home, making it hard to feel comfortable. My parents also only understand depression as a common cold that should be cured after hospitalization. I don't know what to do anymore; I feel like a stone.",depression

20191,"I mean, it's as simple as that.
I'm tired of living like this. Tired of living in general, and everything it involves — interpersonal relationships, people, politics, economy, thinking, expectatives. All that crap makes me feel like shit and I wish I could turn it all off. 

However I don't want to die. That would hurt the people around me. That would hurt my mom. And my little sister. And, unlike other situations, I wouldn't be here to (at least try to) fix it.  They'd be left with the same nothingness that I feel, but worse cuz ofc death of a loved one is worse than just my own personal regrets. 

So I just wish I hadn't been born. That my mom had had a miscarriage — that would've hurt, yeah, but not for long —, or that I'd never been conceived, or something. I wish I was a blank space in the Universe. Something that had never existed. A hole or something like that.
They say energy can't be destructed and I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I could just disappear completely from existence and leave no trace, I wish people would just forget everything about me so I could die without it being a sin. 

Is there a way to stop feeling like this? Cuz the only way to stop existing is dying, and I've already said why I don't want to kms, exactly. Is there a way to avoid it? Can it get better?",depression

I still have a couple around but it's not the same you know. No female can replace a bond between my friend group. They were my niggas lol but yeah I'm only 18 and kinda willing to throw my life away already. My heart feels so cold everyday. From drug addiction to doing shit in the streets. From being abandoned at a young age to being homeless with my family. From people always looking down on me and the darkness I surrounded myself with. I despise humans besides my best friends and my family. I hate people. I'm ready to go I really don't care if I live or die. It's crazy because even my therapist told me at a young age I'd be a threat to society anyways. I'd be afraid to admit she was right. Materialistic things don't matter to me. I feel as if almost my only purpose is living for my gang. I don't feel happy ever. I just hate everyone and everything. I'm ready to go. I miss my friends. goodbye.,depression

Nonetheless, she said that my mind is simply trapped in this pesimistic way of thinking, and I have to believe it can and will get better using therapy and medication. 

But at this time, I do not want to. I've had a strong, suicidal episode recently. I'm waiting for it to come back and drive me to an attempt. Seriously, will these thoughts pass by or what? I have a strong sense meds won't help with that and I'm scared if they would actually work. I'll probably start taking them tomorrow.

20001,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression

20724,"Is being indecisive a symptom of depression: Yes. In fact, trouble making decisions is one of the most common psychological symptoms of depression. Other depression symptoms — such as difficulty concentrating and lack of motivation — can make decision-making even harder.

It was a video of me and them doing that…. I insisted they deleted the video which they did as well from “recent deleted” I then asked him to show me his Google photos to see if it was backed up there but they didn’t use it and did not know what it was.

Once we broke up I told them that anything they have of me like this to delete it and they immediately called me to ask why I mentioned that and I said I just don’t feel comfortable and asked them if they happen to have anything. He said no but he is just so twisted I feel like there could be a possibility that they still have. 
They said that if I thought by telling them to delete they were really going to and that they didn’t have anything because last time he tried I told him to delete it. (Watched him too!)

It’s been a few months since we broke up and I still think of it and panic get really depressed about it.",depression

20720,"I’m a 22M, raised in a close knit semi-strict religion, only surrounded by that community. I had a rough childhood with mentally ill parents.

I left and traveled around the world at 18 and developed some PTSD from a few situations. 

I came back, got involved with a very toxic deceptive woman, (she had untreated BPD), and this got me outcasted from my religion, which meant all of my friends and family. Then her and I broke up the same week, and I ended up homeless for 6 months, isolated. 

Many more situations continued to disturb my life and traumatize me, but now I’m no longer in a toxic relationship, but my depression is so bad I don’t even have thoughts in my head anymore- only rumination or flashbacks. I don’t know how to socialize. I still never hear from my family or all of my old friends anymore. 

Only now have I been able to begin starting over after losing my whole support system, and I don’t even know where to start. I’m scarred from all relationships, my mood swings, anxiety, and social issues are all over the board.

20468,"I have a situation that I won’t go too much detail, but I’ll probably write a lot about it

My gf/now ex ended things last weekend because of her severe depression after she was crying about everything and didn’t want to put me through it. She told me she always pushes everyone away. She lost her two year old boy three years ago and never got help to grieve. We also found she miscarried just before the weekend too, however before this she told me she was not wanting the baby.

The day after this happened I shut myself off from my phone and apparently she tried to contact me, raced around to my apartment and was shaking giving me a big hug thinking i’d done something to myself (wasn’t my intention).

Since then I’ve felt down about it. I made it clear to her that I want her but I understand that isn’t important right now and her getting better is key, that I would stick by her no matter what. She appreciated this and said let’s see what the future holds but that she needs space between us. I agreed and respected this. She also said she still loves me.

She came over a couple of days ago and I was on the phone to customer service. When she spoke to them they asked who she was and she said “his partner” which confused me. She invited me to IKEA after I finished work so I could help her with buying stuff, we went and got some food and overall we had a laugh (like our earlier days).

I’m trying to give her space but she keeps contacting me about things in the apartment, etc. Her mum had asked me to reset some laptops for her but I was given no deadline and had been very busy lately.

My ex tried to call me multiple times this morning about the laptops but I was working. I called her on my break and she was very aggressive on the phone. I mentioned doing this as a favour but she called me an “inconsiderate c*nt” because of what her mum had done for me. She also complained at me that if it wasn’t for her nothing would have got done in our apartment and that she was in there today sorting stuff.

What originally caused her to leave our apartment and go back to her mums were these low moments she’d have lashing out because of her depression. My issue was i’d react to it, turn it into something more and walk out the room, so when she was being like this on the phone I wanted to be the opposite and tell her it’ll be okay and i’ll sort it. She spiralled into a meltdown with me and hung up.

I sent a message after saying it’ll be sorted tonight and i’ll drop the laptops off, that I do appreciate everything her and her mum have done.

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like this is a further step back and she now hates me. She seemed to be warming back up to me when we were at IKEA. I still want to be there and support her when she needs me, but I feel like after this, depression aside.. why would she even want to consider making a go of things with someone she sees as “inconsiderate, dragging feet, etc”. ?

I plan to keep giving her space until she reaches out again, but I keep thinking that in the long term I’ve severed any chance of her returning. I want to show her I’m not like that, just I’ve had to juggle everything so I’m finding it difficult to complete jobs she wants alongside balancing my own life

I want to support her through her depression so much, I love her, but it just feels like she hates me right now",depression

20203,"A lot of people talk about the Winter blues, but for me Spring by far (at least in recent years), is painfully depressing. 

It’s like the smell in the air, mixed with the temperature and longer/brighter daytime present this fake sense of happiness. 

It’s as if when I’m outside, things seem “too happy” and that scent in the air is gut-wrenchingly nostalgic of a past-time that can never be felt or experienced again. Because I’m not capable of it and I’m too worn-down to, anyway. 

I actually remember when I was little (29 now) that I loved clear, sunny weather. I looked up the forecast almost obsessively ahead of time, banking on those days of where there are no clouds to block the sun. Not even partly cloudy. 

It’s perplexing to think I was once like this since nowadays, I despise sunny weather. I genuinely feel better and more comfortable when it is cloudy with rain. Especially the eccentric types of weather where it looks as if nighttime has arrived too early, but instead it’s just a storm brewing. Not to mention, I am at my peak mindset and performance late at night.

Mind you I'm not morbidly obese nor do I have anything that prevents me from moving my body correctly. Sometimes after trying to exercise, or after a day in which I move a lot, I tend to sleep for more than 12 hours straight.   
The doctor told me about the possibility of having to give me Venvanse if I don't get any better, which is a more dangerous medicine for me. I'm diagnosed with  hypercortisolism (pseudo-cushing), depression, anxiety, ptsd, and in the process of getting evalued for autism (""aspergers"") but I've never had symptoms of ADHD or anything, only some things that overlap with autism, like sensory issues, so I'm scared of getting addicted to it or not being able to get off of it.

20084,"I 24(f) have spent the last 10 years of my life in a horrible depressive state. Despite this, I have gone to university, always been a people pleaser and maintained a fairly nice life. I have a nice car, my dream job and I have bought my own house. I realise this seems so nice and it’s such a far cry from reality to say I’m struggling but honestly things couldn’t be worse. The job that was my dream feels so difficult, all I do is work all week then spend my weekends drunk. I’m trying to break this habit but it’s hard. If it hadn’t gone on so long I would think it was because of alcohol but because I have felt like this for so long I think I am just destined to feel this way. I want to die but I’m too scared.

20889,"So I'm having an off-day where I just feel empty and not feel like anything. Wanting to at least attempt to get out of it, I tried journaling about my self-attacking thoughts and it turned out to be .. a lot of them. I currently suffer a lot from anxiety attacks due to a very low self-esteem &amp; my financial situation (I'm living paycheck to paycheck without savings) and honestly I just feel down all the time.

I've talked to professionals in the past. However, it lead to nothing because of my own stupid stubbornness. I'm too hard to work with &amp; fix since I just believe I can't change, even though that's bullshit. I can't even start or finish anything, which makes this so hard to go through to fix myself. Honestly, I'm scared to death that I will always feel this way for the rest of my life.

Here're my dark thoughts that I wrote down in just a few minutes. They're a lot.

I'm not even sure why I post this. But I just felt like it, I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

* I’m insecure
* I’m unable to make decisions
* I feel depressed
* I feel uninspired
* I’m not productive
* I’m not a good boyfriend
* My financial situation is

* I don’t love or even like myself
* I get angry quickly
* I can’t handle my emotions well
* I’m not a fun person to be around
* I don’t feel like I’m a person
* I don’t feel like I’m learning anything
* I’m scared I will lose my girlfriend
* I’m scared I will think about suicide if things don’t get better
* I am not a responsible person
* I don’t have passion for anything
* I don’t feel like I got a (good) sense of humor
* I never have anything substantial to say
* I don’t have the ability to tell a good story
* I’m not an attractive person
* I have a really thin and ugly body
* I don’t think I’m intelligent
* I’m anxious all the time
* I have very bad social anxiety

* I feel like I won’t go anywhere in life
* I am scared I won’t have a sustainable business when we travel
* I’m not a confident person
* I don’t have the attention span to read for a long period of time
* I don’t feel like I have any integrity
* I don’t feel like a professional would solve any of these problems because I won’t listen or take it to heart; I just don’t care
* I have no charisma
* I’m a people pleaser because I feel unconfident if people won’t like me
* I don’t have a great personality
* I run away when things get hard
* I have no ambitions
* I’m chronically tired
* I’m lazy and don’t get anything done
* I give up quickly once things get too hard
* I keep dwelling on the past
* I can’t forgive myself
* I have trouble getting out of my comfort zone
* I never put effort in anything

20706,"Just as the title says, I really don't know what to do with myself.  Both emotionally and day to day tasks. 
I was laid off almost 2 months ago now and I find myself struggling to be/ wanting to be productive, I have no interest in doing anything, and just feeling abandoned on an island. Yes I know I'm struggling with  depression,  that's nothing new in my life. 
My partner is the sole bread winner at the moment and I'm struggling with my value as a person and as his partner. He's very much an absent partner at this point. He plays his game every day all night (and the whole day on the weekends) to de-stress. He ""helps"" by doing possibly one task a day which is usually feeding the dog as I make dinner. I do everything else. I do all cleaning, shopping,  cooking, administrative,  and ect. I've had talks with him asking of him to do more and his defense is that he ""helps"" and it honestly pisses me off that he refuses to understand no matter how many ways I try to express to him I am struggling. He is a part of this household and I am not is caregiver.
Hes already not an affectionate kind of person. His version of cuddling is putting his arm on my lap for the maybe hour we spend together on the couch during dinner. And I except this about him. It just makes me feel even more removed from him when I'm struggling with my value.

I'm out of lost as to what to do. I find myself paralyzed daily. I want to work out and lose weight, but I'm too ugly to be seen in public. I want to go out and make friends, but my nuero divergences tell me I'm too weird too. I want to work on a better career, and can't do a thing except stare at my courses. Everything I want requires steps and I can't bring myself to take them no matter how hard I push.

I just needed a space to pretend that I am heard. I would love any tips if there are any out there with finding and solidifing your  self worth. Thank you.",depression

20681,"There is a persistent feeling of uneasiness and insecurity that permeates so many of my actions. I feel like somehow, unconsciously, I'm sabotaging my own future. Academically, socially, romantically, it feels like I'm constantly out of the loop on some essential piece of information that's going to come back and bite me in the future and ruin any chances of living a comfortable life. All I really want is to be modestly happy and to have the space to enjoy the few things that make me feel that life is worth living (family, love, reading, cooking, hiking, etc). But there is this never ending feeling of insecurity that I'll never achieve this. I know there are no guarantees and that our future is really out of our hands, but it just gets me down so much knowing that there's a possibility I'll be alone in the future or I'll end up too poor to engage in my passions, or that my life will become an endless stream of meaningless labour and bills, or that I'll reach a point where my opportunities in life have irrevocably passed and I'm trapped in a depressive, meagre existence forever. Probably sounds dramatic, but I just can't help this way of thinking, I always feel like there's something better I could be doing, some area of my life that needs to be optimised, some chain of decisions that once met will lead me to the best possible outcome. At the end of it all it just makes me want to withdraw and give up because of all the pressure.",depression

20017,"I have been severely depressed since I was in elementary. I am in college now. I never intended to make it this far. I truly didn’t see myself making it past 16. And now here I am, years later, wasting away because I didn’t plan for this.

I don’t know what stopped me. My life feels so disposable right now. I have no job prospects after I graduate next year. No experience under my belt. No passion in what I’m studying or doing with my life. There is nothing in the long run that’s keeping me here.

I want to believe it’s the people in my life but the happiness they give me is only temporary. I can’t depend on them forever to keep me up. I can no longer support myself. I have nothing.

I never sought professional help because I don’t have the resources to. No money, no proper insurance, no support from family. Nothing. I am so lost and scared. I really need help. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",depression

Eu comecei a me cortar com 16, quando a pandemia começou, eu não sei oq estava fazendo e logo minha mãe percebeu e me levou ao psicólogo, eu fiz terapia e tomei remédios pata melhorar. Infelizmente descontinuei minha medicação, de antidepressivo e sonífero por não ter dinheiro, e acabei tendo a pior ou melhor ideia possível. Tentei me suicidar com 17, e serio, eu nunca pensei que minha vida chegaria onde chegou, pq mesmo eu tentando melhorar, eu ainda achava que era ruim alguém como eu poder se sentir feliz mais uma vez. 
Eu sobrevivi, mais a troco de que? Eu não tenho nada para fazer aqui, e eu sou uma inútil, pq logo eu teria uma segunda chance? Só digo que quanta mais eu pioro, mais me vem a ideia de que eu não quero morrer, eu mereço, mais não quero. Eu esperaria, se soubesse que tem algo pra mim no futuro. 
Vejo meus antigos colegas de escola indo trabalhar, fazendo faculdade e criando uma família, mais eu ainda sou uma garota de 16. Que não cresceu, que não cresce com o tempo.

We have a family history of depression (I still take antidepressants and so does my hypersensitive daughter), so the PCP wants to discuss depression with our son, which makes a lot of sense to me… but… aside from fatigue and it’s after-effects, he doesn’t have many depressive symptoms.

20126,"Being high functioning is really draining. 
I can uphold a mask of normality for a period of time, but Jesus Christ is it exhausting. 
In the presence of people, I act. I convince them that I’m fine, I begin to convince myself too. And for a few moments sometimes I forget. Sometimes.
Until I get into bed and I’m staring at the ceiling, feeling an empty sense of longing for God knows what. Why do I feel like something’s missing? 
Emptiness engulfs me at the realisation of the futility of it all. Life.
My body aches, my eyes burn and I just want to be unconscious. 
And I think to myself, is this all that there is?

Most of my life, I’ve felt this dark presence lurking in the corner of my mind. Like a feral black dog following me around, just hungrily waiting to devour me. I somehow always manage to find strength to keep moving, but it always follows. 
Sometimes, I just greet it, and lay down in despair.

20876,"I’ve had diagnosed major depressive disorder and social anxiety disorder for about 2 months. Note how I said diagnosed, since I believe I’ve had it undiagnosed for a lot longer. My school work stresses me out, but I still have mostly good grades. I’ve been pushed and shoved by other kids at school, and called a ‘white supremacist’ when someone in the hallway saw me listening to the confederate version of the civil war song ‘The Battle Cry of Freedom’. My mom and brother fight all the time and I never hear the end of it. At school it’s hell, at home it’s chaos. I’ve resorted to banging my head on walls and tables to the point of getting dizzy. All of the advice and ‘coping strategies’ don’t work, the antidepressant medication I was prescribed doesn’t work. I am in tears while writing this, and am on the verge of a mental breakdown.",depression

20443,"I'm tired. I going, have been going, must keep going. But I feel my body dying from the inside, I've not time to do the things I love and know and enjoy because I'm working then sped my free time recouping from working and when I'm not working I'm studying or schooling trying to escape the weight that crushes me so. I'm not letting go as in giving up but if you don't want to stay thats something else I'll simply have to be ok with. Because you're not the chase of this weight. When you're here, around, not trying to impress me or make me happy, just being yourself. The weight is there but I'm stronger. Strong nough to push back, to hold it with ease. But till you return I hold, I break. Cracking from the inside out.

All poetry stuff aside, I'm sorry. I don't know how to say it, engineering is stressful and it's my last quarter before I graduate and I have a lot of work together don'te in this project. There's no easy way to say the stress is literally killing me. I pass on food, I don't sleep, and when I do the stress follows me there too. I work on it hoping to finish it so it'll be done but I'm not even sure if you'll want to be with me at that point. I scared you won't. I'm not afraid to admit it. I'm so close to being done....I'm just not sure if it's with school or life now 😞

I give, I give, I give, I break, what's left to give when there's nothing more to take.  My glass is empty, full of nothingness. Full of emptiness, yet I push on, because it's all I know",depression

Antidepressants HELP I took bupropion xl 150mg for four days and I was HAPPY I went from suicidal to happy in two days medication can help and if you don’t want to because you want to muse drugs example when your on it is much easier to stay sober and staying sober helps a LOT with keeping a stable mood.

I just wanted to say that if you need help there is something out there for you I used to be against antidepressants but they help so much it’s crazy i was happy and looked forward to the next day instead of waking up with dread I would literally go to bed early.

I used to make up excuses to not get the help I needed because if I’m being honest in was scared to be happy I was so used to being depressed I was scared of change but when you get on an antidepressant that mood lift makes you realize that change is what I needed and it was just my depression holding me back.",depression

20898,"My eyes begin to swell up with tears even before I begin to write.
I am a 22 year old girl struggling to find hope. I wish I could extract everything in my brain and export it onto this Reddit post instead of having to type out and remind myself of why I feel like this but I’m hoping I’ll only have to do this once.
You know, I try really fucking hard. I practice gratitude whenever I can. Everyday I wake up and I journal. I tell myself I’m grateful I am healthy, that I have both my legs and both my arms attached, that I have a roof over my head, that I have 20/20 vision, that I have a heart that beats.. and so on. You get the point. I try and I romanticize my life. I try and enjoy my morning coffee extra hard, I try and be present, I try to enjoy the mundane things about life just as much as the big extravagant things. 
But the truth is, My first distinctive memory is disassociating for the first time when I was 5 years old. I remember zoning out because of the fights that would go on at home. I remember being depressed before the word depressed was ever even introduced to me. I felt like a zombie as a child, I felt like i was always  outside of my body looking in. I felt different. Like my soul was not meant to be here. I lived my life very alone, I never had anybody and I filled the voids through whatever caught my attention. In the end we all day. Why are we here? What’s our purpose? In the grand scheme of things nothing matters. Really, nothing matters. The world would be okay without me.What’s funny is to others I am a bubbly sweet kind happy girl. People would be shocked to see this side of me. I’ve tried. I hope that is evident. I just think the more you know about life, the more you’ve been through, the more you realize how meaningless all this is.. is what makes you detach and unhappy.",depression

20350,"   Seems to be a theme hear about taking hints.  A lot of these posts come in waves.
Basically don’t choose someone who didn’t choose you. If they’re fine without you in their life, then never take them back when they come back. People who are OK with you not being in their lives are not worth your mental well-being. 

In the past when I had read these, I never really understood them. I do now. 
As hard as it is for me to accept, because to accept it means it’s real. They never cared. They left. They’re gone.  Forever. They never coming back. They never wanted to. 

I’m their now. It’s been a long road. A painful journey. One that I’ll never repeat again in my life….ever!!! it isn’t over yet. And by that I mean the outcome of me.  I know I will not be that same I was before I met my ex person. 

      I don’t know if I’ll have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore. I don’t even know if I’ll have the motivating desire to want a better in life that I had when met my ex. Large part of me went silent. You could even see a large part of my died. The part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life..
I didn’t have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood.  

  

   I listened, eagerly to her stories. I told her mine. I did whatever I could to make her dailies a little easier. To give her a reason to smile. If it was sending her dinners, a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy, or just telling her a joke..(mostly bad ones🫣)
I tried my best to show my person I loved her. 

To me she was the world, my tomorrow’s, my happy, my love, my life, MY ONE…

But to her, I was no one special. In her own words, “there was nothing special about me”.

She took the best parts. She got better. She had options. She chose. She didn’t choose me. I was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from. That was what I was to her. That was my value to her. 

I have finally excepted this. I can’t lie to myself anymore. She chooses not to be in my life, and she chooses to ghost. I don’t know what tomorrow will hold. But I know I don’t want to see it. The pain within me only increases. They say with time things get better. For me it seems to be the opposite. I’ve always been different. Maybe that is my curse. I’m not like the crowd. Doesn’t seem to be a good thing for me, more like a curse.
I should’ve remain secluded. I should’ve remained to myself. I should’ve known that no one would understand. I should’ve known no one would care….",depression

20766,"long story short:

for a better understanding, i harmed my body and soul so many times because of untreaded trauma ( i think), i drink booze on the weekends since my 18th birthday, and later some party drugs came in.

if i would have a glimpse of which pain i will live through back in the days i would have never touched any drug.

i had so many breakdowns in the last 3 years and it feels like i will never be the person again i was.

with the booze and the drugs came panic attacks and anxiety disorders.

i am not the same anymore and dont know if this ever will pass.

i feel miserable, no energy, cant laugh anymore, its like being buried alive.

how did some of you guys survived this and are your cognitive functions and general well being better?

i just try with all in my power to get healthy mentally and body.

20725,"(cw:mentions of ED)

My grades are average. At school I was better than others at languages and took part in olympiads, but now that I’m in uni, I just suck at everything. You can tell me grades don’t mean shit and how some smart and talented people didn’t do well in terms of academic performance.

So what? I’m not one of them by any means. I’m not good at scientific research in my field, either. They say, some people naturally think like scientists. They ask the right questions, challenge ideas without taking them for granted etc. I’m not capable of that.

I’ve had an ED which allowed me to have an extremely low BMI so for some time I felt like I’m better than others at least at something. I was dumb enough to try recovery and now I’m technically not even underweight.

I had hobbies like chess and drawing but I don’t have enough motivation to do them regularly, and anyway it would probably take years for me to become just ""good"" at it.

There are no other areas in my life where I could better than average. This is it. You could tell me being above average should not be that important anyway. It’s totally fine if it’s not for others, but for me it would mean a lot. I would feel like my existence isn’t absolutely pointless. I can’t just live and try to enjoy stuff.

20491,"Ever since I (21F) was younger, i struggled with emotions. I’d cry whenever frustrated or angry and still do to this day. My parents would often say I was a drama queen for this reason. Kids would also talk about me being overly sensitive and crying too much. But i was genuinely hurt. Nowadays whenever I’m sad or cry, those memories get in my head and i convince myself that I’m faking it; like my feelings aren’t genuine, like i am doing it for attention even if I am genuinely hurt. I feel like I can’t trust myself. I struggle with OCD, depression, and anxiety. I’m taking Buspar for anxiety, ashwaganda, and did some OCD therapy for about 2-3 months weekly. The OCD aspect somewhat improved. However, my depression has skyrocketed. I’ve always been able to make friends easily however it wasn’t because of my personality but the way I can match others energy. I Can get every guy to like me not because they like me but because I’m easy to talk to. I feel like I don’t even have an identity, a personality. I don’t feel like a person and therefore, don’t feel deserving of love or anything. I struggle with being insecure sometimes as well. In eighth grade, these boys who i thought were friends of mine came behind my chair and repeatedly called me ugly until I cried. That moment haunts me forever. Another moment, i love my mom to pieces but something she said killed me. I was a rotten girl growing up. Again, i was mad at the world. I felt no one understood me. I had a strict dad who is emotionally unavailable and a helicopter mom (not like this anymore we are best friends now). They again would always make incidents my fault for being too sensitive. One time I went too far with being a rotten preteen and my mom said you know I used to always dream of having a daughter and now that I have you this is not what I wanted. Along those lines. Heartbreaking to hear. All of these experiences have made me feel like no one. Like I’m empty. Like no one really cares for me. My family doesn’t even care to talk about what I learned at university, the place where I spend 30 hours a week at. I feel somewhat invisible. I feel empty but so full of sadness. I lack empathy and feel awkward when others express their emotions. I want to be happier and feel joy and excitement and empathy and i just can’t. I feel broken. I have friends and supportive family, they know I struggle but they don’t know how bad. I can’t afford to break down everyday. I feel traumatized by life and feel unmotivated to keep moving forward. I won’t do anything to end it. I’m expressing its really really hard for me right now. I just want to know. Is this forever ? Side note: only hobby I have time for is exercise atm",depression

20033,"So, I can't anymore. I didn't think I would get here. I hope it won't be a long post. Thank you in advance.
F(26) I've always been the soul of the party, the kind of person you love to be around. Always joking, with super positive energy. Few people know what I'm like in my spare time, and that in fact there isn't a day when I don't wish to die.
If someone can understand that I feel alone since I was little. I have always sought to be seen, appreciated, respected.
My parents divorced when I was 5 years old. Since then, the relationship with my father has not been, because he is the most lying person I know. All my life he just promised me things and never kept his word. Now he has his family, which he does not take care of. Her children live with him, but they actually live like I did. My mother was always away in another country. He tried to compensate for the fact that all his life he ran after the perfect man and thus he neglected me. He never chose me. To want to move together to do something new 2. She chose men who, I'm sorry, did to her. And I had to grow up with my grandparents. With my grandfather always beating my grandmother. I saw all kinds of arguments, fights, scandals and everything that a child should not see. I always grew up with words like ""you're not good for anything, you don't know how to do anything, you're like my mom, you're like tactu"" My mother has 2 brothers, who are super narcissists. That they gave me a juice when I was younger ""they raised me"". Grandma raised the men of the family as if everything was theirs. And my mother and I always had to do everything. From food, cleaning, money... Everything. No, they are men and we are women. Ever since I was little, I used to fight with everyone, because I was always different. I don't consider that my purpose is to find a man, to have a child and that's...as my family wants. I always wanted more. Because of this, my jobs were not exactly easy either. I was a team leader at 19, and it still wasn't enough, although no one in the family did more than me...
My grandfather died 2 years ago, and since then the family fell apart even more. My mother left again to another country, after her boyfriend who is my age and treats her worse than anything.. and I stay at home with my grandmother, who is also mean.
I tried everything, to meditate, to go to a psychologist, to stop thinking about all the things. Anything...
I feel alone, abandoned. As everyone sees their life, I remain here behind, worthless, with nothing. I have nothing. Not a day goes by that I don't think I want to die... Thank you.",depression

20715,"Just last year I was diagnosed with Chronic Depression, I was given antidepressants but I hated how I physically feel after taking it. 
It made me feel worse (dizziness and nausea are just a few). I was asked to go back see the doctor January 3 but I didn’t want to.

This time I promised myself 2023 will be better year as 2022 was a shitshow for me.

I wanted to get and feel better. I worked out a lot, did a lot of fun things, enjoyed old and new hobbies. But then at some point when all of the things I do are done I’m back at the pit of despair.

Sometimes I go out to new places and document everything, enjoyed a lot of alone times because yeah it was fun but most of it was the reason of “I don’t know until when my life will be”

I do feel shit, I have so much to be grateful for and I feel guilty to feel this way. But unfortunately I do.

I have to distract myself to avoid killing myself, how fun is that? Lol
I used to enjoy my alone and quiet time, now I still do but quiet?idk, sometimes I’m now I’m afraid of my own thoughts.

Tonight I laid down the floor, looked at the whole size mirror and stared at myself as if I was a dead person with open eyes. It felt so real, it feels like I am seeing the body in the mirror but I don’t actually see myself,  it feels like my soul left hahaha idk if it makes sense.

So many things to be grateful for but I just feel so empty, so tired I just wanna rest. It’s funny how I also start singing Sza’s song kill bill but I changed the lyrics to “ I just killed myself, not the best idea” 

I wish it was that easy to snap back be okay again, genuinely okay but nope, it doesn’t work that way tho. So yeah, I just wanna let it out here. I really barely don’t open up to people even my family and friends about my problems yet alone my depression, I just don’t think they’d understand and also I know they have so much on their shoulders I don’t wanna add up.

Oh yeah, check ur friends who are happy and as if all is well, it might be just sort of a mask, and do check urself too.  

But really, I feel a little better letting it out here tho, I think 🙂",depression

20396,"For the record i am not suicidal but i do feel like i have no way out of this. I have a concerning health condition that has been neglected for the past 6 years and gradually getting worse. I am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed write-up of my life and issues soon. I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. Sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better.

My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.

And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.

My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen. Realistically I don't think my prognosis is too good. But people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so I think thats a good but far too little too late now",depression

20168,"For as long as I can remember, I have always suffered from anxiety. Perhaps it runs in my family. Yet I was never able to name it or put a label on it. During COVID, it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage. For past half year, so much has happened in my life that I feel like I am living someone else's life. The only good thing that has come out of it, is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how I channel it. I am so heartbroken to see that I mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage. 

Anxiety builds up in me for various reasons. Sometimes, it is related to work, sometimes things not going my way, or sometimes pretty mundane things. It slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled. Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me. I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something. During COVID, the unfortunate victim became my spouse. I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time. So once I spoiled the mood around me, or picked up a fight, I would see that things are fucked up. I always blamed the spouse, work or boss for the fight or issues, yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments.

It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling. I feel so ashamed and resentful. The sad truth is that I don't see any quick remedy for this either. You see, there will always be some dormant resentments inside me. There are issues between me and my spouse, that we cannot agree on. There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc. And whenever anxiety builds up, it needs a channel for relief. I'm afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over.

I have come to this community to ask for your advice, that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time? I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive. I can't change my spouse, I can't get that promotion. But I can always put effort to find a new job, always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments. How does one make this change? How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too? I need some encouragement and guidance. Thanks",depression

I feel like everyone else is on a whole other plane of existence, meanwhile I’m stuck beneath the surface just trying to breathe. 

Every time I talk to someone, I have to check to see if there’s something on my face once I leave because other people don’t know what to say to me and it’s always so fucking awkward. I try so hard to appear normal, but other people see right through it. I can’t relate to anyone. I can’t talk to anyone. I try so hard but I just can’t.

And it’s embarrassing. I feel stupid for being this way. I’ve tried so hard to fix myself and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’ve been in therapy for over a decade and the only thing that’s changed is I’m really good at talking about myself.",depression

20840,"Don’t really know how to explain this further. Throughout my life I’ve been tortured with medical issues and a dysfunctional family and so on and so fourth. This made me able to “resist” depression if that makes sense. I could, essentially, ignore it. I could force the happiness through and suppress anything else.

Little things have made me happier than normal over the last five months, including someone I thought was my friend, until it became obvious that likely isn’t the case. Before this I had entire, fantastical and delusional ideas about what the next few months could look like between us.

Things are getting worse between my family too, and now I’m dealing with a shitton more responsibilities that will likely be falling on me within a few months from now. That and this crumbling relationship (only friendship, and the farthest one has ever got for me) are starting to push me to the end of the line. I’m finding myself randomly breaking down more often and I feel like, unless something drastic happens, I’ll explode.

The best visual representation of this (it’s fairly stupid and niche, I know) is a scene in Umbrella Academy 3 (ep 7, trying not to spoil anything) where a big problem was averted, then this was celebrated, and then the crisis comes back with more ferocity than before in an extremely short amount of time.",depression

I hope he actually kills himself before me so I can go spit on his grave and cry at the same time, because he is all I have left and he ignores me and complains that I fuck up so much and how I can’t do anything right. And I can’t do anything if I leave him he’s gonna attack me and most likely ruin my life. Even if it’s already fucked.

I suffer from back pain, and naproxen is super effective for me. I’d like to restart Zoloft, but I’m concerned about the impact on my health when used with an NSAID. I have a couple of doc visits scheduled to see what they can do for me, and if there is any way I can do this safely or with minimal risk.

But in the meantime, I’m curious what your experience is. Does your doc make you do blood work every so often while you take an NSAID? Did they put you on a different med? Do you just stick it out during pain and not take those types of drugs? Do you do physical therapy? Etc?

20108,"I've been depressed for a few years now. I don't feel totally lost. Somewhere inside me, I still have hope, I still have a real belief that it's possible for me to feel normal and happy again. But there's a much stronger feeling, an overwhelmingly powerful one, that even if I *could* be happy again, I don't deserve it. I don't deserve support from others, I don't deserve to make small gains for myself. Every time I start to move in a positive direction, every time others give me advice and offer help, every time it seems like I'm finally digging myself out of the hole.... I stop myself. I hurt myself. I don't let myself get better, because I feel like I don't deserve to be better. 

I hate it. It feels totally inescapable. No matter what progress or advantage I'm giving, I end up deliberately damaging it and tossing it away, because I can't escape the feeling that I deserve nothing but suffering, that it's an injustice to the world if I get better.

20524," 

This is a pretty ignorant question but is there a distinction between internally induced and externally induced depression?

For instance internally would be those cases where your neurochemicals just betray you, you're moving through life just fine then suddenly you're bedridden with catatonic depression and only after being heavily medicated can you function.

Externally would be a concatenation of failures or disappointments or miseries which blacken your view of humanity and existence itself to the point that you no longer see the good in people or the joy in experiences and eventually an reach a point where you're also dysfunctional and need to be medicated.

Has anyone experienced the former?",depression

20240,"Hello,

My (now ex) SO has been diagnosed with depression. We have had a wonderful relationship built upon many common interests and values, and family blending. He pursued me, and we both wanted a serious committment. 

He admitted he felt depressed to me 2 months ago, when I asked him why we had been struggling to do outside things together. There are a few large situational stressors in his life atm, but he had not expressed the severity of some of these to me until now.

I feel I see the worst of it, but friends get his 'all fine here' mask. Family seem to see more of it too, but they also come across quite critical which I feel makes him withdraw more.

* He seems to not be able to make plans in advance anymore, even of a few days, meaning I cannot clarify if we will see each other until hours/late at night the day before. I have asked him what we could do to make this easier, work with how he thinks etc but he has not suggested anything. 
* When I am visiting him, he is often engrossed in his cellphone, or just wants to watch TV in bed. The feel of absence hurts, but I try to co-exist and just be there. I have expressed this can be upsetting, and that idm if we do our own things together, but I need some of our time to be more about us interacting. This has been up and down, with things having seemed better lately.
* He has become more irritable, sometimes snapping at me or just seeming short all day. I can't seem to get anything right. 
* I feel like we are always having a conversation through a different filter. I could be talking about something abstract, and he will somehow interpret it as a criticism. eg. the other day I had mentioned a friend bought new clothes for her partner as he was in need of some replacements, and SO took this as a sly comment at him to update his own wardrobe. 
* I try to do nice things for him, leaving notes, bringing comfort items, making food, offering to talk if he needs to. He never wants to talk, and the nice things seem to leave little impact after an hour.
* The task of organising our time together is mostly mine, I have asked he share more of this how he can, such as both of us deciding on food options sometimes or suggesting something to do (just home stuff like movies) but this seems to have caused more strain despite him saying he was happy to do it.
* He has admitted he struggles to discuss his own feelings but also told me he will always be honest, which is now untrue as he seems unable to do so. 
* When I try to talk about my feelings on a matter (related or unrelated) he tends to get frozen up and doesnt say much. If it involves him in any way, he has been snapping more and recently and told me he does not have to talk about things just because I want to. I was hurt.

Things took a turn recently, and he ended it. I was confused, as things had been on the up that week. He had started meds a few weeks prior, and had a promotion. 

He said he doesn't know if we fit together but cannot explain why, then that it was actually him because he cannot sustain a relationship right now, then that he doesn't know who he is and just wants to be alone to figure himself out and cannot see ahead of himself or focus. But said he loves me and thinks I deserve better.

I don't know what to think. Is this typical of anyone else's experience with depression and their SO? If so, what did you feel when it was you? Did you come back to your partner if your symptoms improved or you recieved working treatment? 

I have been depressed before, but recovered with treatment, however I can see all our experiences will differ and how people react to a partner will not always be the same. It manifested differently for me, so I am seeking insight and advice on how to proceed.",depression

20292,"This may turn into a ramble and be somewhat disjointed so apologies in advance.

I'm a 21 year old guy from the UK and I've been planning and thinking of ways to end my life since the start of the year. I've been in a dark place for as long as I can remember, never seeing a point to life when we just die in the end, been bullied since year 3 of Primary school all the way until I finished my GCSEs. From the start of 2023 I've hit the lowest I think I ever have, with little to no care for life anymore and just wishing I was dead. I've planned the typical things like hangings, thought of the overdose routes, dangerous driving, whatever I have access to I've considered what ways I could kill myself with them.

As far as life goes I never really saw a point to it if death is just going to be the inevitable end, so why not just make it sooner? 

I cut off contact with all but 3 of my friends from secondary school shortly after finishing GCSEs, 1 of which died last year, 1 was my ex (we remained good friends, had some rough patches though) who just up and blocked me midway through last year with no explanation as to why, and the last I don't talk to all that much. I am quite an angry person from all of the bullying I've endured and most of the outbursts are often me exclaiming ""I just want to KMS/die"" and everything in relation. I have an online friend group who has often heard my outbursts but they take no notice and seemingly don't care.

I was at college until 2020 when I completed my course, but of course COVID happened and my future plans were all thrown out the window. So I've mostly just tried to cope with that and find jobs to act as a stop-gap until I can find an opportunity in the field I want to be in, but I've lost all motivation and care for finding it.

I always see the things of ""do something that makes you happy"" or ""find someone who will listen to you"" or whatever other bullshit people say to make you reconsider killing yourself, but none of them are useful. If anything they make me want to do it more. At this point in my life I'm nothing but a burden and a mental weight on those around me, I'm in this dark pit and quite frankly don't have the care anymore to try and get out of it since I always seem to end up back here but falling further in every time. I can't live through another cycle of this process.

I'm done, and I think it's time I start preparing and fulfilling some of those plans I've made.",depression

20214,"I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore, and it's a vicious cycle. And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember. I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me.

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.

If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.",depression

20466,"When I was 18, I had moved out because I has a strained relationship with my family. I moved away because I wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired. I ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south, halfway across the country, at my father's suggestion for an easier life while I worked and got my degree. And the distance did exactly what I wanted: it showed my parents that I was strong and capable and mature and that I was an adult. But it also created a great longing for home. 

Life was easier. I got a better job, I bought a house, and I live comfortably with my husband. But... We don't like it here. We like the small city, the restaurants, the proximity, the healthcare, etc. But the environment and climate do not align with us. We are northerners at heart. We like the seasons, fall and winter, the hills, the mountains, the streams winding through the forest. We miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes. 

But I also miss my family. I miss my parents, my brother, my nephew. I miss my childhood best friend and her family. I am heartbroken seeing years pass and I am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine. I am just incredibly lonely here, and I want to be with them. 

There has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back, but the biggest one being how expensive it is there, and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our well-playing fields. So years pass by and we stay here, while wishing we there. 

Well now my parents are getting older, approaching their 60s. They want to retire, but they don't want to retire there, they want to retire in the state I'm currently in. 

So then, becomes a new dilemma: do I stay in this state that doesn't make me happy, so I can be with my parents (and potentially my brother in time)? Do I move back home and enjoy my brother's company for as long as I have it, I have my friends, my climate, and my job? Either way I'm giving up something that feels non-negotiable for my complete happiness. 

I'm overcome with this intense sadness that I've spent all the years where I could have had it all being away. And now they are gone and I feel as if the life I have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone. 

Ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that I know they love and enjoy and that we do as well, and they don't budge - this is their plan. I feel selfish when I push too hard. 

I don't know what to do. I'm overwhelmed with sadness. I just accepted a job in my career because I just graduated but its even further south and even though its an amazing career opportunity, I feel like its a step backward in the life I wanted.",depression

20457,"Hey all. I'm getting worse. I've been battling depression ever since I finished high school, and it's been progressively getting worse. I thought getting a girlfriend would fix it, it doesn't. Nothing seems to help. I've come to realize life is pointless and it doesn't matter what I do to myself. I've been hurting myself, cutting, etc. and lately I've started drinking.

 It started with just a couple of nights of drinking on holiday. Then I realized hey I kind of like alcohol. Started to have a couple of beers a few times a week. Now I'm having them every night and bought my first large case of them ""just in case"" I wanna  have some beers the next night. 

I know this is a step to the worse and that I could stop right now with minimal discomfort. I just really don't care anymore and I want someone to notice I'm not okay because I can't really talk about it myself to the people I know. At the same time I don't want this to turn into full blown alcoholism because that would be bad, but at the same time I don't know if I even care that much anymore.

If I didn't have my family I would more than likely end my life.

20931,"So I’ve been battling with both anxiety and depression for the last seven years and last six months, I felt good better than I have in a long long time.  But I don’t know what’s going on, but I suddenly feel like nothing is worth it anymore. 

I’ve been ignoring everything assignments tests just staying in my room and laying in bed. I even skipped my classes today.

I don’t know if this matters or something, but my closest friend is basically going through a mental breakdown and it just reminds me of myself and the situation I was in a couple of years ago.  

And she’s the only person currently that I could talk to because the people I trusted before we’ve kind of lost touch, and I don’t know how to talk to her without making things worse for her. 

I wish there is someone I could talk to, but at the same time I have really really bad trust issues and I don’t open up to people. 
The last person apart from my friends that I let in broke my heart, so people are not really my favourite right now. 

I just need something, I don’t know what but I just want to feel better. I was doing so well and I hate feeling so empty. I hate feeling like I don’t care because I care. Just can’t get myself to do anything about it.
I don’t know what to do I just want this to go away. 

I haven’t felt like this in a year. Even then I didn’t feel this bad. 
I can’t seem to figure out why I’m just so unaffected by anything rn. 
I don’t know what triggered me. 

I’ve cried all morning and honestly I hate being vulnerable I just don’t want to feel this awful anymore.",depression

I don't have a future, I don't want to explain it fully because I have a thousand times, I just don't. I don't got family like other people, I will be pulled out of school eventually, I'm gonna be in foster care starting within this year, I have a lot of trauma and life long medical problems. I feel like an animal that should be euthanized already. I am in constant suffer. My autism is a large factor. I do try to be happy, it is something I want. I also want to feel sad because it means I cared enough about something to become sad over it, right now I feel nothin. I wish hope would drive me, but there's no use in hoping in my situation.

Trying though. Practicing good hygiene, my acne is clearing up, taking breaks from school when needed, good dose for my pills, puzzles, sports, etcetera. Might improve, so far nothing unfortunately. Rather die than waste all this time and money",depression

20660,"Sorry In advanced for the rant of anyone even reads this lol, 19m, I used to use this app a lot to talk people out of hurting themselves or give people a chance to vent when I was really depressed as a coping mechanism I guess. I started feeling better as I graduated high school with honors and began moving towards an exciting and new time in my life. There were ups and downs sure, but I was probably happier than I’ve been in years since entering college. I found new hobbies, met amazing friends, worked out, etc, I even finished the semester with all As. That’s why it hurts even more to still be in this place. Nearly all of my online friends ditched me like they always do, half of my real life friends just stopped showing any interest In me, I can’t find a reason to give af about school and I’ve stopped all but one of my hobbies (piano). It’s like once I get a taste of feeling okay everything falls apart and I know what I need to do to fix it, but I just feel so alone and I need so badly to share my thoughts with someone but despite being in a school of ten thousand plus people, there’s not one person I feel okay turning to for help. I just want it to end, it never gets better and it hurts so much because I have a lot of love for other people and I just never seem to have that love reciprocated. I never leave anyone, but people always get bored of me and move on to the next. I just want someone to love me man",depression

20727,"23M. I’ve never been a super social guy. I’ve always been shy, chronic low-grade depression, etc., and it hasn’t been conducive to making friends.


I had one irl friend who I met at a job four years ago. We were hanging out more frequently and getting closer at the start of this year, but I found out something so fucked up about him a month and a half ago that I was pretty much forced to completely stop talking to him. 


I had one online friend, and I was very close with her for two years. She completely moved on from me a few weeks ago, and she made it clear to me a few weeks ago that I was useful for a certain time in her life, but now I’m not useful to her anymore, so she’s moved on with new irl friends who she just recently met. 


After over a year of applying and interviewing, I got an office job in November of 2022. I was getting a lot of positive feedback, wasn’t screwing up any tasks, etc., but I was suddenly fired without a clear reason two weeks ago. I don’t have enough experience to reliably know if I’ll be able to get another job in the same field. 


I don’t have a job. I have literally no one to talk to, not even just an acquaintance or cousin. I don’t talk to anyone from any of the schools I went to, no one from any of the jobs I’ve had, and none of my extended family (family drama from a decade ago screwed everything up). My parents turned into raging alcoholics six years ago, so I mostly avoid them. I tried making friends at the most recent job I had, but I don’t think any of them really liked me, tbh. My family used to have family friends who would visit, and we would just do different things together in general, but we don’t do shit since they became raging alcoholics. 


Idek if it’s possible to recover from this level of isolation. There’s literally nothing in my life. I’ve went through almost 24 years of life, and I somehow don’t even have a single acquaintance to show for it, not a single person to talk to or who genuinely cares about me.",depression

20668,"I can't keep going on

What can I say? I'm depressed, very hard to find motivation to move on, to complete tasks. I'm in college now, and studying became so hard I can't describe. In school I was one of the best students and a couple years later remembering and learning even a tiny pieces of new information is extremely hard. Even if it's something relatively easy. Back in the daysI could read for hours, not only fiction literature, but books about history, science and everything. Now I'm barely completing the minimum to stay in college.

I'm trying to be more socially active, go outside, go to gym, try to learn something new every day but everything stays the same. Well, not exactly the same, because it just keeps getting harder.

I don't believe I'll be able to finish college, find love(I'm really bad at social interactions and meeting new people), find a job, and become happy. Every day it is only harder and harder to move on and deal with problems.
I've also fallen in love with a girl that don't find me interesting.
I hate being in love, because it never plays well, and in the end, all relationships I had, ended badly. My last gf dumped my on my birthday more than a year ago and I spent next half year to recover from that. Than I have fallen in love with this girl, we had some nice conversation and I did fall in love, but she didn't. Of course I'm not blaming her for that but damn, I haven't fallen in love like this since the second grade, my feelings for her are so strong. I usually lose the ability to speak adequately and formulate thoughts when I am around her.
On the bright side, two weeks ago I bought myself an acoustic guitar, which was my little dream for a couple of years, and I'm making some progress in that direction. And this despite the fact that never in my life I've done anything even relatively connected to music. But I like it.

Peace to everyone who read this to the end. Hope you're doing okay.",depression

20685,"For some context my abusive ex is the reason why I was in the mental hospital. Someone who I thought was my friend was talking to him and flirting with him knowing what I’ve been through. The betrayal put me into yet another depression a month after my hospitalization. 

2 weeks ago I weighed 132 and now I dropped down to 127. My appetite is barely there and I’ll often skip out on meals because I don’t have the energy to get out of bed. My dad is commenting on how little I’m eating and encourages me to eat more but I’m not hungry and eating seems like such a chore. My best friend (sister to the friend who betrayed me) will also encourage me to eat and will give me snacks. It’s not an eating disorder but rather I just completely lost my appetite and when I am hungry eating seems so tiring. I don’t want to be this way.",depression

20590,"I often feel if I could accept my depression that I wouldn’t struggle as much as I do. I wonder if the fight and the hope, however dim that light might be, are the reasons why I can’t seem to shake the bone crushing sadness. It’s so PHYSICALLY uncomfortable now.

I haven’t handled becoming a full time caregiver to my very sick wife well. I haven’t grieved having to walk away from the work I love to do so. I haven’t managed to find any peace with the idea that I might never know physical or sexual intimacy ever again. 

My depression, anxiety, agoraphobia all pre-date these turns of events, but the way they’ve been amplified and my inability to effectively cope has caused me a shit ton of distress. I find that I tend to isolate even more than usual because I genuinely can’t imagine anyone wants to spend time or energy on someone with such a low self esteem. I have tried to take steps towards combatting the loneliness, but every time I get close to breaking the cycle I’ve created for myself, I run away and hide. I do wonder if this is because I know I can’t handle another heartbreak or rejection and so I’ve subconsciously determined the risks are too high, that connection with anyone else could push me over what it already a precarious cliff.

I just want safe connection. Someone who knows what and who I am going in and accepts the subsequent ups and downs while remaining as committed to my well being as I would be to theirs.

I come here and post sometimes, but nothing much comes of it. I guess I hope that one day the right person will see my post at the right time and the universe will connect two lost souls so we can help each other navigate out of the hell that is depression.

Is that you? Please feel free to send me a message. If you have the same fears that I do, I promise you that I will work to ensure we have a safe space to talk, to figure out, to grow…I dunno…is this all wishful thinking? I guess I want something more tangible to cling to…",depression

I don't know whats going on inside my brain, I can see its functioning like a system doing its thing but I clearly don't know what its doing and why im stuck inside it. Made me curious but I started thinking what if there is only one voice behind every person or any living thing on this planet, like there is one spirit just experiencing itself of its variant energies in its own creation of all forms of life on this planet and that we are all one but part of the play. how do I stop my consciousness its painful to be awake, in our sleep we don't know where we go, also forget we even have a body and that there is consciousness. literally what am I thinking about. anyway all this seems like a dream but the game is running slow, one day the battery will drain out and I will finally experience the real me (which i think is pure awareness/consciousness of infinite energy)",depression

20028,"Throw away account for this. Myself M15 almost turning 16 had a fight with my mum yesterday and it got physical. I can't exactly remember who hit first but it got to the point that hands were on one another and spitting was involved. My mum had been charged 50 dollars for something on her credit card and I had asked her to buy something for 10 dollars. It turns out the currency was off on the thing I wanted to purchase. She then bought it up to me and to me it seemed like she was yelling. I have always been quite sensitive to yelling and I always take it really personally. After we had the conversation, mid way through I went to my room and locked it so I could breath because I was really stressed out. She then came from the living room into my room, bashing the door open and breaking my lock, breaking my door as well, it fell of the hinge. She came into my room while I was crying and was yelling at me. I told her to get out with swearing involved because I was really stressed out and upset. She then wouldn't and she kept getting right up into my face as if she was going to start throwing hands at me. I then was starting to involve talks of myself going to hurt myself, she then said that she doesn't know what I was on about and got really defensive. I then said can you just give me 5 minutes to breath and then I will come speak with her, after going back and forward for about 15 minutes she finally left me alone and I shut my door and dragged my dresser in front of it. I then had a full on panic attack for a solid 15 minutes and I could barely breath and I was smacking my head onto my wall and on my desk. She then came back to my room after she had sit in the lounge and listen to it all happen while she was sitting there watching TV. She came back and was back into a calm state herself which is quite a normal thing for her and she came in my room and comforted me. I kept breaking into tears while she was talking to my cat. After the situation she calmed me down after about 30 minutes of a continued panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I feel really scared still, although she said that she was sorry for it. I still feel really scared to be around her and I feel really sick after she spat on me and I am hurting still really bad after she hit me.

20767,"https://www.anxietycentre.com/articles/let-down-effect-anxiety-after-stress/

I found this article today and I feel like it describes exactly what’s happening for me… but for me I’ve been experiencing anxiety and depression.

I’m 28 and have a long long history of mental health issues. Generally speaking they’ve improved over the past 4 years with lots of ups and downs.

Since December life has been highly stressful: Death in the family, health issues, housing issues, work, school, you name it. 

I had SO much adrenaline pumping through me for months.

The past 2 weeks everything has settled: I found stable housing, moved in with my partner and the relationship is great, school is done, my Dad is supporting me financially. Everything is suddenly great…

Except the past week my mood has dropped fast. Intense anxiety, crying at work… the worst part is, I’m supposed to be feeling happy? There’s nothing that can explain the feelings?

So this “let down effect” is my best guess. Anyone else experienced this? I’m praying time will start to relieve some of these horrible feelings…",depression

20062,"So, like the title says: my boyfriend has depression. He already suffered from this even before we met. So, I knew what I was getting myself into. But I did not care because he seemed so willing to be open, to communicate (or at least try his best and give me as much as he could), happy (as much as you can be happy in a depression) to be with me and most of all he showed me so much love. 

Months have gone by since we became official. And his depression has been getting worse. I don't care, I want to be there for him all the way through everything. I love him. I would do so much for him (and I do, but I would do basically anything for him). 

But I have felt him getting less open and he doesn't communicate his thoughts and feelings at all anymore.  Whenever something is bothering him or whenever he is feeling bad, I notice, I can just tell. But then when I ask him what's is going on, he always says ""nothing"" (and then continues to show behaviour that clearly shows he is feeling some type of way). Whenever I do push through to have a conversation with him, he gets really quiet and doesn't answer most of my questions, and if he does it is usually a one-word-answer. 

He isn't happy about anything anymore. Not even about me, I think. There used to be a time where he made me feel special, wanted, loved. Now he gets annoyed or even mad if I say or do anything wrong (when all I want to do is help him). I am distraught. I love him more than anything. I can not handle the heartbreak it would give me to lose him. We are so far in together. We had (have) plans for the future. But without him actively showing me love and trying to communicate, I just feel like I am giving him so much of myself but not getting enough back. 

He says he has no time to work on everything.
Granted, he has his education and work. Which is already tiring for him, especially living with depression, an anxiety disorder and an ED. 

I guess the conclusion is that he has no room for this relationship anymore. But due to me being selfish, I can't bring myself to break up with him.",depression

20755,"Hi, 

So I really need some help/pointers in where  I go wrong or what I can do do fix mu current life. 

* Short info: 
* Fucked a girl who got pregant and kept the kid. (I iniciaded the  child custody court) (ugly court battle) 
* My son is 3 years.  Lives 50/50 with his mother and me. 
* High performing job, future is looking bright but I work 50-60 hours weeks.
   * When  I or my son get sick the backlog of work is INSANE.
   * Work is now taking some seriously battles in my head, like I dont really know how long I will be able to keep this job going. To much to do, there is no way ever that anyone will be able to do this job
   * Im a people pleasere so I fuck my own schedule on a daily basis at work.
* Poor as fuck, all money went to court, batteling bill to bill now. (wife didnt have to pay since she is on welfare and then the ""tax-payers"" are paying for her court.
* Creditcard debt of $1300 but I cannot pay anything on it, all money goes to bills and my son.
* Car loan debt $10.000, cant sell car since I travel 1 hour each way to get my son from daycare or his mother. 
* Renting the my current appartment. 
* I might be able to save around 100-200$/month if Im lucky.

I feel that my life is just fucked, completely and utterly fucked and I cannot for the life of me see any light anymore. I was so happy before, life was so good before kids, court a maniac mother to my kid. 

I just long so much for the old day and I cannot for the life of me ""enjoy"" the current times.   


Spoken to a couple of therapists but I don't know, they are quite fast to add diagnises without doing any tests...   


My dream now is to just run my car as fast as I can into a wall to make all the pain stop, I tought life was hard. But I had no idea how utterly awfully painfull this existence is.   
Like I run that scenario through my mnd at least 100 times a day and I just long for it. 

Of course I wont do it, I have a son etc. But I really just wished that a car could crash into me, kill me on the spot etc.   
I always thougth I was a strong man. But im a weak one.... Well....

I try to remidate the feelings with friends, loved ones, loads women, working out etc.   
But nothing feels ""good"" or satisfying. Nothing currently feels satisfying.   
My schedule looks something like this:   


05.00 (I or son wake up)   
08.00 Son at day care  
09.00 Back home   
09.00 - 15.00 Work   
15.15 - go get son at day care  
16.16 - home.   
16.30-20.00 Time with son, food playing, goofing around etc. 

20.00-24.00 (8pm-12 pm) Work  


Those days where my son is not at my palce:   
I tend to get 1,5 hours traning in per day.   
Good foods and some rest in between aswell. 

But something like this, weekends looks the same

05-06 wake up  
08.00 - 18.00 (8 am to 6 pm) work   
18-20 sparetime  
20.00 to 24 work  

Working out has always helped. But only for the short time when Im in the gym.   
I dont do any drugs, Alcohol is not my thing, plus I got LOADS of alcoholism in my family so I dont want to go the same way there...

A little backstory… I graduated Highschool at age 15, took an 8 month break before starting with university and when I started I had to move to new country and manage everything by myself at 16, I started slacking ever since I had arrived tbh I barely did my work cause I had no clue where to start or what to do but whenever I had an understanding of the work and what to do, Id get really proud of my outcome but moving on from that i was barely attending my lectures and doing anything by the end of the year so I had failed my first year, I wasn’t very proud of myself however I did it to myself so I had to accept and move on from it and figure out how to do better, I’m now 17 repeating my first year and classes have in the beginning of this month and I feel like it’s almost the same thing as last year.

20623,"This fucking word – I hate it utterly.

I can barely bring myself to pronounce it – every last one of its four letters; what with the shit it entails.

It'll have you entailing, rather — which is a character who'll ***never*** be as respectable, reliable, and upstanding as you'd be, had you never asked for... for... that – that thing there in the title, you know the one we all need, and so desperately at times, even though that's not even what a great deal of us needs, but really what everyone should have for granted – a basic human right, you'd call it – a necessity as eating or drinking or fucking(fucking; yes fucking) or, lest I sound too coarse or even border vagueness as I mention fucking, I meant — **loving**.

What help? It's love. I want love. I don't want to be treated as I need a fucking ramp going up a staircase, or given a discourse of pity like I'm disabled somehow or another because I'm depressed, I just want love — none but love, except — great — that's even more shameful to ask than help itself, and you do it once, you're marked for pitiful clinginess (~~death)~~, so to publicly ask for help is something l'll never dare again — oh no, I won't.

You may find yourself comforted; warmed, even, upon your request for help among friends, but if you're a man with any kind of zeal(or anyone with such vigor; really) then the moment you're elevating yourself up ever so slightly in a competitive manner again, that fragility you've shown is going to be used against you in every single fucking regard, and you'll never make it back to that league you once held your held high on.

So I'd rather suffer proud now, even if it kills me. At least it'll be a literal death – a clean wipe, opposed to this sick sort of castration.",depression

20713,"Alright I have to get this out, basically my mother had gaslit me for a long time, taking control over my life and emotionally abusing me by always blaming me for everything and getting my father on her side so that he would blindly support her. This went on for multiple years and stopped at some point (as far as I know, Idk if I have just gitten blind to it) it was not too long after all of it that she started saying that she could not remember any of it, this has gotten to a point that I even started questioning my own memory of my childhood. I often find myself questioning if I remember something right just because of this and I can't really get myself to trust her 100% even getting scared of her sometimes that she might do something to me.

I also remember wanting to jump out the window at like age 10, the intend was there but I think it was also to see if my mother cared. I ended up not doing it because her reaction was just nothing, I didn't expect her to just not care at all.

I also had a lot of pressure due to my grades being very bad, I at one point got even worse grades due to me trying to escape into my fantasy, that did go on for about 2 years, therapy could have helped but no one thought of that. My grades eventually got better and I graduated and am now at university.

I'm currently trying to get therapy and hopefully come to terms with everything in atleast some way.",depression

20253,"I’m a 23 yo female who has been through the ringer the past few months. Started with anxiety based on some life circumstances and changes but quickly progressed into anxiety and depression. Living with my fantastic boyfriend but I’m currently unemployed and this is my biggest struggle right now. I just started w a new therapist and upped my meds. however, my thoughts are bad and I’m scared I’m getting to the point of no return 

The problem is I will rot living w my boyfriend right now, I’m doing nothing but waiting for him to get home. He’s doing his absolute very best and I’m so thankful for him and all he’s done for me. We aren’t breaking up and we have talked it through and both understand that moving back in w my parents is probably a good thing, as I will be able to focus on myself and my mom is a fantastic support system and is no stranger to depression/anxiety. My goal is to heal and find myself. With hopes of coming back when I get myself through this storm. 

Anyone else have to do this or something similar? It’s a very trying time for me and I know that by doing this I will have to take responsibility for my issues with my mom pushing me through it.",depression

20132,"I’ve been dealing with depression since I was a teenager. I had a suicide attempt in high school, had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for a couple weeks (which was highly traumatic)and was on I believe Zoloft for a few months until I moved to self medicating with alcohol and realized that the 2 don’t mix well. I’ve seen multiple therapists, but I have a very hard time being honest and open and I’ve had therapists outright drop me as a client because I wasn’t making progress. Also when I was drinking heavily it was hard to make appointments so I stopped going. 

I’ve come a very long way from this. I very rarely drink now, but I never went back to therapy or medication. I cope by staying extremely busy but I struggle on the weekends when I have less to occupy myself with. I feel like I need something to help. I’m unsure about meds because even before I could never find a dosage that helped and I don’t know if I want to start that process over again. And I also now have a masters in psychology and i have enough insight into myself to be able to understand my behavior. So I don’t think a therapist can do anything for me that I can’t do for myself, and I doubt that I can be completely open. 

Idk what I’m looking for, I guess just advice if I should try to get treatment, if it would be worth it.",depression

20116,"(26 year old female) sorry for the long post… I’ve been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft &amp; then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often &amp; have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so I’m thinking it’s a medication issue or lack of something. I’m mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since I’m not doing well lol.

20445,"I think they might help me but I'm just awful at sticking to taking meds. I start off taking them everyday for maybe a week then I quickly fall off and start ""forgetting"" to take them. I'm not avoiding them. I literally forget that I'm even on medication. Plus medication in general tastes horrible or the pills are huge and get stuck in my throat and just hurt going down in general, so I almost prefer to forget. And even when I manage to finish a whole bottle, it doesn't do my laziness/motivation any good because I will then procrastinate asking my doctor for a refill, and procrastinate going to the pharmacy, or sometimes I don't feel like taking my money and spending it on meds that week or something always comes up. And the longer I put off refilling the meds is more time my body is without the meds, and whatever effects they might've been having are never able to reach their full potential. And for the short time that I take these meds, I don't see much change, in terms of helping or even side effects. They may as well be placebo. And since I get no benefit in the short term, it makes it hard to stick with in the long term. I'm not motivated enough to keep taking them. I can never stay consistent with medication which makes it difficult to even get better, I just feel hopeless. I have all these problems but can't stay consistent with the possible solutions to help me and always end up back at square one.",depression

20227,"Hello

I dont know whats wrong with me. Nothing in life is fun, brings me joy or motivates me. All i wish is to lie in bed all day and stare at the wall.

I opened this thread because lately i have more and more thoughts  like ""whats the point of this? why do this another 60years?"" and after another successful ski weekend with family i just prefered to stay in bed after skiing for 10min.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not something that just started to happen a few weeks ago. It follows me since childhood i would say. Nothing ever motivated or brought me joy me except computer games as kid but not even games nowadays bring me joy at all. Somehow i got through all schools till university without doing anything and missing about 20% of classes. Even in university my motvation is still equal 0 and thus I am still stuck in bachelor after 6years.I write exams from time to time because i guess thats something you have to do in life but my motivation is negativ. But when Ifind a tiny bit of motivation to write an exam, I usually write very good grades while not attended 1 class at uni over all these years but they dont make me happy nor motivate me for more.

But its definitely not the issue with the chosen path. I tried different part time jobs like char mech, hotelero(?), sales (not retail), vet or logistics. ZERO motivation for any of it. It always started fine while I kept up my mask but usually after few weeks I couldn't find motivation to stand up anymore and quit. But also here they usually were happy with me and few even called me year later to help out again during summer holiday etc.

I dont find any sports enjoyable. handball,unihockey,ski,sailing,boxing,... tried and tried nothing lasted over a month, except gym once because I thought all my problems are because of my physical appearance. Not even this gave me any motivation even though after intensive few months I got way more attention from women, people treated me better and so on. A normal human would be so happy with this change, for me it was whatever lets go back to bed!

&amp;#x200B;

This no motivation follows me everywhere! I had a few romances including two longer relationships which lasted 1years and 2years with very beautiful&amp;great character women. BUT the same problem again NO MOTIVATION. Obviously I fucked up and they eventually left because I had no motviation to put any effort in. 

I have great friends since childhood. Even now almost towards 30y they still meet multiple times per month and go on holiday 1-3 times /year since we are 18. even here NO MOTIVATION i usually join the holiday once a year but this is like enough. It is just not fun to me to hang out. No they are very good people, alone for the fact they still ask me out even tho i go deep sea most of the year. I just dont want to deal with any humans i guess.

Kinda same with my family. I could call them any time and the financials are covered by my father. I just dont want to be alone.

what i tried so far:

3x different therapist, ambulant weekly session =&gt; completley useless. I lose motivation to go there after few times and dont feel i achieved anything ever from talking

medicaments =&gt; worst decision ever. While it completley killed all my thoughts which i enjoyed i had even less motivation to leave my bed and the sweating side effects made it even worse. What a wasted year until i found the motivation to contact someone and say what happened.

clinic =&gt; after 1 week i just wanted to leave and this stayed with me for the remaining 2months. Felt like a waste of time i had 0 motivation and every morning to stand up was a fight with my inner self.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: no motivation or joy in life since childhood for anything. literally 0 and i just wonder whats the point to live another 60 years laying in bed?

good grades? hot gf? amazing friends? good looking? nothing brings joy

I just dont know what to do.

I just smile and say generic bs. When im not ok. I just bury my head in the sand and pray it gets better, that itll go away. IT NEVER FUCKING DOES. NOT IN 2 YRS IT HASNT. So y should it change now?

20709,"Hi. I’m a med school student who doesn’t know how they’re feeling. I don’t know if I’ve been feeling this way for so long because of my bad grades, which I heavily suspect but something just feels off. Like it’s not the whole picture.

Waking up every morning and getting things done are hard. If I didn’t have classes to go to, I would not move out of bed at all. Getting dressed and brushing my teeth are such a huge effort that it takes so long to get done. I feel neutral or sad almost all the time, like I forgot what feeling happiness is. Watching videos or listening to music would help sometimes, but I don’t find any fun in them anymore. I’ve mostly withdrawn from talking to my friends who don’t know but they don’t suspect anything yet.

I frequently wish I wasn’t alive by thoughts and urges but have not acted on it. Like not wanting to live but not wanting to die. I don’t know what I’m going through or if it’s all just a byproduct of stress and failure. Online tests and the DSM-5 all point to depression but my mind says I’m faking it. 

I have friends who listen, and my brother who knows about it. They all asked me to get help but I don’t know if I warrant it. Sorry if it’s a messy block of text, my thoughts are spilling as I type this. Thank you.",depression

20160,"I’m 23 years old, and used to be happy and had motivation and wanted to work and do things. Last couple of years, I’ve had no motivation, it’s hard to work, I feel lazy, I feel slow, I can barley talk to people without sounding stupid and it’s hard for me to listen and remember what people are saying to me. Basically I just always feel tired and slow and no motivation. I know I’m a smart person, but I feel dumb at the Same time, like it’s hard for me to learn things, but once I do learn it, I’m really good at it. I also feel like I have issues learning, because I overthink things and think I will fuck up somehow and think about how there is no way I can do this.  I was off work for a long time due to COVID, fucked up sleep schedule, etc. and then I got laser eye surgery, I got almost every complication from it (made me really depressed), and then I lost my job for not getting fired (also made me really depressed cause I’ve been there for 8 years).

I’ve spent many weekends fishing w my father, because I didn’t have anything else to do, bc I have no friends.and it’s like even tho I love fishing it just starts feeling like I’m always missing something I need regardless of what I’m doing, I’m missing friends and social interaction. I moved out of my parents house and in w my grandparents to work over here and I’m at a very low point. Every day is painful. If I’m at work I fucking hate it. Being at home is ok but still I’m lonely and depressed, and having nothing to do brings my loneliness to center stage. I’ve though about suicide a lot. It feels good to imagine the pain ceasing. I can’t stand to watch myself get older and each year im still the same. No friends and generally miserable. I’m just so done with life.",depression

20224,"I’m a 22 year old male, I really can’t be bothered to let all this bullshit play out for the rest of my life.

My family is dead, or too abusive for me to risk speaking too. 

I have let countless opportunities get away from me and now my only skill is dishwashing and cooking, which I hate and I am forced to do it to survive and pay my rent.

I’m by no means physically attractive and constantly am told (subtly or not) that I am ugly. Really like my facial structure itself is terrible. I’m losing my hair at this early age, and have a gross and large surgery scar on my stomach. People look at me with disgust in public. I have such low self esteem I cannot ever stand up for myself and if I try I get laughed at. Constantly treated with no respect unless it’s sympathy or pity, and I’m very awkward and weird.

I always make mistakes, can’t handle myself under pressure, constantly miss things and can barely make life decisions on my own, which I’m forced to do because I don’t have anyone else. It’s like my brain is a level lower than everyone else’s. When I have a chat with people they can insult me and I don’t even realise because I am so slow until later and then I feel so upset and resentful.

I had a group of friends , they are all good looking and live at home with their parents so they are able to have so much money to party and hangout , as we’ve grown out of Highschool age they’ve seen as I’ve devolved and aged badly and how pathetic, spineless and valueless I really am. I feel like I’ve been exposed. Now I don’t get invited , and when I do occasionally see them for something I can afford , I am the pathetic butt of the joke.

I used to have girls interested with me , perhaps because I was younger and better looking and confident because I was unaware. Now I seriously have no chance .

I don’t know how to have social interactions anymore, and I always feel like I said the wrong thing, that I’m different from other people in a terrible way. 

Out of sync with life and destined to be one of the unfortunate disgusting underclass.

The only thing that stops me from ending it all is that I have a sister who is younger than me and I am quite close with. She is well put together and successful, and since she has no family either I know how much it’ll devastate her to lose me.

These days sometimes I think she would be fine though…

20419,"I (23m) don't want to continue this anymore. I got out of a 6-year relationship back in august I left cause I wasn't happy anymore and hated myself to the point of not loving her anymore. I was 320 lbs when we broke up and now I'm 240 lbs I go to the gym for about 10 hours a week sometimes more. I'm stronger than my friends that got me into the gym and that makes me happy sometimes. I see a therapist every other week and I don't even tell him about some of these deeper-down issues about not wanting to live anymore cause he is a school therapist and I worry that I would get a restriction on campus cause of it. I have been on one date since the breakup and I really wasn't that interested in the girl I met her on an app and just went on a date so my parents would get off my back about not going on a date since the breakup. I feel invisible to women I'm actually attracted to that in the gym or around campus I try to smile and make eye contact but I can count the time's anyone has actually looked back and smiled on one hand. I feel like my depression ruined my one chance at love and not I'm just a fat ugly person who is going to die alone no matter how much weight I lose no matter how much better I look I don't think it is ever going to get better. I did get with my ex for a moment but I think my heart is truly empty there were no new feelings of love I think I need someone to kick start it I need someone new to care about the bring those feelings back. I don't know how long I can continue this life I feel like my peak is going to be 5 years from now when I'm still single and alone and graduate from school and am making 100k and have a nice scat pack challenger in the garage and my ram parked outside in a luxury one bedroom apartment. I'm on the apps and I get like maybe 5 likes total a week over all of the apps I'm using and I usually get ghosted after the first message. since I updated my pictures recently I have been getting likes from much better-looking girls and I don't even message them cause I feel like they look too good for me and probably swiped the wrong way and I don't want to message them and they ghost me cause they did swipe the wrong way. I know that is the dumbest thing but it's how I really feel.

20726,"My life is alright, but I'm very depressed all the time, panic attacks, suicidal. I feel that nothing in life matters and that life is some weird thing I can't relate to. I only live for sex, gambling and money, however, those things don't even bring me happiness.  I can't do relationships. I push people away unintentionally and hurt them emotionally. Every. Damn. Time. I wish I could give a fuck about life, but I can't. Why am I still here? I suppose this is a rant, I just wanted to talk to someone, haven't really done that in a while. I'm thinking about doing some dumb shit like live 10 more years, save every penny, then bet on red on roulette. If it hits, cool, I'll double down, if not, who cares. I've felt no attachment to anything or anyone recently. I'm applying for a job this week, had a job before, had some savings, I just gambled $1k, ate a steak dinner, and burned the rest (only had like $9k). There was no turning point in my life where I suddenly didn't care about anything. Since I was a little kid I can always remember having schizophrenic episodes but was discredited as I was just a ""dumb kid"". I would always see shadow people and be irrationally scared of the dark, and I would see monsters and just scream and cry silently. All the way until I was 14. Then I stopped paying attention to it and just realized if I didn't care then it doesn't matter. I had a girlfriend once. I was with her for a week, we fucked once, we went for 5 hours, I just got up and left at one point. Never talked to her again. Hate my family, but I'd do anything for them. I hate religion, I hate politics, I hate material things, I hate people, I hate consciousness, I hate breathing, I hate thinking, I hate eating, I hate sleeping. I hate life. I can so easily be anything I want in life that it becomes obsolete to try to live.  Life is just creating problems and then finding the solution, endlessly. Refused to take medication because why would I want to feel a way that I don't? Not going to trick myself into wanting to live, that's stupid.

20402,"I was diagnosed 2 years ago or so. Rapid cycling Bipolar 2. Since then I have been through dozens of medications that never worked. Finally, after some trial and error, good old lithium seemed to do the trick. I felt better than I have IN YEARS.

2 or 3 months ago… I did what apparently is a common thing with people who have this disorder and… stopped taking my meds… I was good! I was happy! I could take on the world!

Weeeelllllll…. Over the last few weeks a mixed episode (that I haven’t noticed until last night) has cause a LOT of problems in my life. I’ve been emotionally cheating (thats a long story that I can’t get into just now.) Girls i was interested in are now no longer speaking to me because they found out I stopped taking my meds. I’ve been sexting, and chain smoking and depressed and hateful and spiteful and… I just can’t handle life right now. I’m in a very VERY bad place. All because I was an idiot and stopped taking my meds. 

I should feel lucky. It could have been way worse. But I don’t know how much worse it’s going to get. I know I need to take my meds now… I do… I just need someone to tell me everything is going to be okay… that I’m not a bad person… that I deserve love and happiness… i promise I’ll start taking my meds again…",depression
20422,"We, both female, have been together for 9 years and married for 3. During the course of our relationship, she has had periods of non diagnosed depression. Well she did go to the doctors maybe 7 years ago and got a few counselling sessions but never went back. She can be fine for over a year and then something switches in her and she just shuts off. This recent episode has been since last Tuesday and she is pushing me away. We have a day off planned tomorrow and she is telling me to go into work. She sits up on her own drinking and listening to music.  She says things have changed between us yet only a few weeks ago we were immensely happy and texting each other how much we love each other.  Yet she is saying we don't do anything and sit in silence. I know this isn't true. We go on lots of walks together, we stayed overnight in a hotel and had a theatre trip at the beginning of the month. I have been away with work for a few days and had a holiday with friends this month too.
She usually loves to make plans but is showing no interest in anything.  She also is quite on top with the house and is not really doing anything other than getting by.

She has issues with her mum (who has treated her appallingly throughout her life) and they are currently not speaking and she lost a close family member 6 months ago so I know things are getting on top of her.

I'm petrified that she is going to end the relationship but I am trying to hide this and stay my usual upbeat self. I've told her I'll stick by her in whatever she needs.  She won't see a doctor or consider a therapist and I just don't know what to do.  She isn't very good at vocalising her emotions and just says she wishes she could have a break from her life for a month.

I suppose I'm looking for answers from people who have felt like this or had partners similar to this so I can figure out if she is just falling out of love with me or is this depression and we will recover.

20613,"I’m going to keep this short because I’m having a mental breakdown right now so it takes tons of energy to type. So basically I’m a guy and I’m 4’11.5 which is one of two things that make me the most suicidal. I can’t accept that I’m always going to look ridiculous no matter where I go. I’m going to have to move to East Timor or something (country with the shortest people) when all my life, I’ve wanted to move to Italy. I just don’t know what to do. I would give anything to be even 5’3. That’s why it pisses me off so much when I see guys who are 5’8, complaining about how they’re not 6’0 or taller. I should’ve killed myself years ago cause leg lengthening surgery is quite dangerous and that still wouldn’t make me tall enough to be taken seriously.",depression

20665,"I been dealing with depression for a long time now, since I was about 12 or so, my teen years were the worse for me as that's when I actually felt suicidal as around that time my parents were having a divorce and I was failing school, never got the treatment I needed for this as my mother didn't like the idea of having to use drugs to make me better and never got me therapy either so I was left to somehow fix myself on my own for many years which I had to do many many google searches to figure out what is wrong with me.  
Right now my depression has been getting worse due to my godfather passing away on 2023 new year's and I had to put down my 16 year old cat 2 weeks ago and that has been hitting me hard. I also don't have a job sadly to keep me busy and I don't have too many friends that live close to me that I can go out and do stuff with(I do still try to talk to them through text tho), but I was thinking on finding some kind of distraction like exercise but I haven't found that motivation on moving forward yet.  I did finally set up a therapy appointment for myself but it took a lot of work to even set it up.   


I'm kinda just spitting word vomit out right now but one of my coping mechanism is Maladaptive Day Dreaming (which if you don't know what that means is a behavior where a person spends an excessive amount of time daydreaming, often becoming immersed in their imagination) lately I have been stuck in my head a lot making up a bunch of stories and just wishing I could be in my perfect world that I made up and sadly its just making me even more depressed because I know I would never be able to live in that world, like I would imagine myself being a superhero with powers but then I end realizing superpowers will never exist and I end up sad, so basically I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this before and what you did to make it stop because I want this to stop very badly as with my own self-awareness I can see where our world is a nice place and you can experience a lot of things but I never have the energy or motivation to experience it.   


Sorry if this is a lot to read but I'm at my breaking point and I don't know what to do with myself and I really want to make this emptiness inside me to go away, I'm tired of living in a dull boring world.",depression

20742,"These last few years my depression has only gotten worse, no matter what I try. My fiancée snaps at me when I try to make sure she isn’t going to hurt herself, my PTSD flares up every time something goes wrong. I don’t feel like I can work anymore but I have to because I have to look after my fiancée who’s got BPD and bring in the money to afford food and rent. 

I don’t feel like I can look after myself. Insomnia has been a bitch for me for years, it’s only gotten worse in the last year. I like to maintain I’m doing well, but honestly I almost took some pills last night and locked myself in the bathroom. I don’t want to be here anymore. But I don’t feel like I can talk about it, because my partner always has something for their own on when I’m feeling low. 

I just bottle, I guess. I want to talk, I see a therapist, but, all the progress I make feels like it get reversed constantly. I haven’t felt this low in years and it’s hard to maintain a ‘it’ll get better’ outlook like this. When? When will this get better?

I’ve been bullied at work, punished for my disability at work, I’ve suffered through a narcissistic abusive mother and a father who just stood idly by. I’ve had an ex SA me and cheat on me. I’ve had friends lie and manipulate me, taking advantage of me. I don’t have a single family member I can trust anymore.

The only thing keeping me going is my dog, he’s only 11 months. I love him so much. I never want to lose him. 

The desire to leave and go to work and never come back is so strong. It’s so, so overpowering that I feel like shaking. I don’t want to feel like this. I don’t want my PTSD to flare up every time something goes wrong, I don’t want my depression to spiral in turn, I just want to be healthy again. I miss the competent me. 

My fiancée has a lot going on, I always understand that. I just sometimes don’t feel like the same empathy I give her for her conditions gets extended to me…I feel like I’m just here for her. Outside of that, I just kinda float in existence. 

I always used to joke that my name means happy or lucky, but I haven’t felt it once. I’m very unlucky. Happiness is so difficult for me to get. I’m tired. 

I will try to stay around. I always have done. I’ve survived all my worst days so far, right? That what I say. I just wanted to vent and someone understand me for once.",depression

20319,Do you ever have that weird feeling where you just have that fear of getting to attached to someone or something? Like you get this thrill like yes finally something good happened but then in the back of your mind your just scared of something bad happening before you know you'll screw it up or something bad will always repeat? I found out I'm moving again and I've lost track how many times I've moved and I recently got this job a few months ago and I am in love with it and I'm scared that I don't find anything similar to it when I move and another thing I'm just scared to lose the people I'm close too all over again. It seems like it's always like that the people I love the most go the farthest away. I've lost a of people in my life and opportunities and I'm scared this is another one of those things. I wish I had a place called home where I can settle and do what I love with the people I love. Sorry for the vent I just needed to let it out I guess.,depression

20789,"My ex-boyfriend recently decided to call it quits on our one and half year relationship due to family circumstances. He's been going through a lot. 

1. Dealing with his parents not taking it well that he is gay and had a male partner. 
2. Dealing with some recent news that his beloved grandma in China is dying of cancer and doesn't have much longer to live. 
3. Hurting from not being able to see his grandma and be able to spend her last weeks/months with her because of visa issues. 
4. Dealing with a potential looming layoff at his company that could impact his ability to stay in the US.

He went back on Prozac a few weeks ago to cope with everything and the resulting depression.

I'm hurt that he broke things off but I understand that the relationship is the least of his priorities given the circumstances. I still want to be there for him as a friend. What can I do to support him through this difficult time?",depression

20467,"I am a 19 year old student in college studying in computer science, who despite being in his 4th semester is still stuck in the 2nd. I am unable to make any lasting connections with any other students I’ve met during those semesters. The only people i talk too are people i have been friends with in high school and their friends. This is our last semester together has the have chosen a pre
University to then follow their ambitions and have the job they wanted. I have become so tired and hopeless that i am just barely following the classes anymore and recently I started not going to any of them if its one of those days. I never thought i would make it past 16 honestly and im even more surprised that I haven’t gotten to courage to attempt to end myself again.

I  am just so tired of all of this, All the things that I used to love means literally nothing to me, I keep getting overwhelmed by everything at the middle of the semester, I keep self sabotaging so bad that i just lay in bed all day or do nothing productive at all. Ive never seen myself in a future where I could be happy with the others and Ive lost all my hopes and dreams. Over the years i have developed the worse eating habits as well as letting my negative self talk become louder and louder to the point when sometimes when I wake up, Im already defeated by it so I see no point in getting out of bed or do anything at all. Why even bother if it’s pointless anyway.

I dont even get why I am becoming like this. I barely understand how I feel, how think or what the hell I am even doing.
I thought I could prove my thoughts wrong by proving that I could do stuff but Im coming close and closer to accomplishing another self fulfilling prophecy each time, thinking about death being the only way out of this since its the only way to stop existing.

Although I think this is true I know deep down that its also a lie. I envy those who can just wake up, go through life and enjoy it. Idk how they do it but I wish I could experience it. Just being alive for once, being human without ruining everything that I do. I want to be able to convey emotions again, cry instead of blocking all of this sadness in my throat without having to bottle everything up until I breakdown, be angery at stuff due to how wrong some of them are, be happy and have way more better days than what I am having rn and laugh at how everything is just absurd with other people. I dont want to stay as this subhuman filth that I have become but every step I take takes me to nowhere so I am just here, standing still while watching everything else moving forward.",depression

Ive never actually engaged in a proper CBT plan since i was feeling like absolute shit all the time and I didnt believe that therapy would help and i wanted a drug to give some energy and motivation to go on with therapy more easily.

20169,"First time Poster so I apologize in advance for any formating issues. 
I just came to realize how numb I feel today. For some contest I (24F) have been struggling  mentally pretty much since childhood.I've had low self-confidence,anxiety and have been pretty depressed for as long as I can remember. Life has always kinda sucked and any good times usually don't last more than a couple of days so I guess all the hurt and disappointment has been building up and now I'm almost completely numb aside from the random anxiety attacks at 3am.
I've been aware of this for a while, but the sheer extent of how tired I am and how I don't care about anything anymore hit me today when I found out that all the neglect towards my studies has caught up to me and will most likely result in me either barely passing uni or not even being able to graduate meaning I will have no degree and just wasted a bunch of time for nothing. The tought of that used to scare me, but now I just don't care that much . I am so lost on how to improve but at the same time I don't have the desire to do anything about it. All I wanna do is sleep and not wake up I wish time would just stop. I don't know why I'm writing this for some advice maybe ?or just venting to strangers online is alot easier and cheaper than therapy.",depression

I was afraid to interact with others and felt like everywhere I went, people were laughing at me. This lasted all the way until I graduated high school. 

Years of maturing and some plastic surgery later, I don’t feel as self conscious but the damage has been done. I hate myself. I feel grotesque and worthless. I want to die so that I stop feeling this way. I constantly wonder why the universe would allow me to come into this world and live like this. Am I being punished for something I did in my past life? 

I have tried therapy but the “relief” was only brief. I would take a picture or catch my reflection at a different angle and be reminded just how ugly I am. I want to accept it but it’s so hard.

20526,I have written this message multiple times over the last few days. Finally decided to make a throwaway so I could have the confidence to post it. I am a late 30ish male living alone with my 3 dogs and cat. I live in a collection of duplexes. I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. The property was sold and the new owner is kicking everyone out under the pretense of massive renovations. The new rent would be triple what I’m currently paying. But the problem is I can’t find anywhere I can afford that’s not double my current rent. The few places I have what were close don’t allow the pets that give me motivation to keep living. It’s gotten so bad that I’m not able to get up to go to work in the morning. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been considering the coward’s option but I guess that’s why I’m writing this. Life sucks and I wish rent wasn’t so high.,depression

20383,"I just feel no motivation to do anything anymore. I don't want to play games. I don't want to watch shows. I don't want to read. I can't even bring myself to do my math homework. Today was a round of acceptances for the University I'm trying for and I didn't get in. And typing it out makes it feel so silly to be this upset like oh, maybe not this round but there are two more rounds that you could get in for. But honestly this was kinda my last straw, I just give up. My friend who said that there was no way she would get in and that we should both go to this other university together got in today and I just feel like I'm not going to get in and I'm going to have to go to that other university and be all alone because everyone I know got in for the really competitive program I was trying for except me and I just can't bring myself to try in school at this point because I will never be good enough because I try so hard and I think I actually understand but I never understand and because I fuck up one question on a stupid test it ruins the rest of my fucking life. I just need to get into this one specific university nothing else matters its just this one. But its never going to happen. Because I was too stupid to not join every club in the school in 9th grade to become the president of them now. Because I never took extra lessons outside of school to learn math. Because I'm just not good enough. I mean I know this one specific university is not the end of the world but it feels like it is. I'm disappointing my family who expect me to get in. I'm disappointing myself because I told myself I would work harder and try harder and cut out all my free time to focus on school but I just didn't do that and now I've ruined my chances. I just don't want to keep trying. I don't even want to go to university. I'm just so tired.",depression

Him and I went through so much together, we wrote songs, we played shows, we did stupid shit 18 year olds did, he made me the person I am today. One time he got on my shoulders in a big trench coat and sunglasses and we tried to buy beer and had the whole store laughing. He’s gone now, I feel like I have nothing, all my other friends, it feels like they’re not there, I feel like I have no one besides my parents, I love life but at this point I honestly don’t care if I die, if I die I die, so what. Nothing feels like it can fill the whole that he left, he was my soulmate of a friend, it feels like we were built for eachother, the hardest part about all of this is that my future feels like tunnel vision and all my future plans included him in some way, now my whole concept of a future for myself is in shambles, I don’t know what to do, I’m lost.

I don't know why I feel this way but its majorly impacting my life.

I've tried everything, I started working out and have lost 20 pounds since the year started and I still don't feel energized. I had to switch to online school due to several factors, but one of them was my inability to make it through the school day because I was just so tired that I couldn't function. I drink dangerous amounts of caffeine on the daily but even that doesn't help. I don't know what to do but feeling this way just makes me extremely suicidal. Being awake is painful.",depression

20947,"almost everyone I have encountered within my life has been abusive to me.. plenty of people are abusive unintentionally, but ignorance is not an excuse to neglect and/or abuse and use people. I almost think it is worse when they are not self aware, because then those people will continue to do it over and over and over again to countless others, feeling blame free. no one likes being called out as an abuser either though, so it seldom goes well when you try to bring it to light.

*sighs*

I become so exhausted with trying to make anyone understand me, or my feelings. half the time it is met with rejection, and the other half is self loathing for being a pitiful creature.

more times than not, I think I deserve this.. to feel this way.. because of that thinking, I push myself into doing things I do not have energy for, interest in, things that cause me so much pain that it physically manifests and makes me ill. I lie to people and over extend myself, as long as it pleases them. I invite more abuse in, because I am certain that I deserve it. I have lost so much will to fight for myself anymore, and my sad truth is... I do not have anyone who is willing to fight for me..

I do not have anyone I can trust to hold up the walls when they start to collapse in. I do not have anyone that I can genuinely believe in their words, because there has never been real action to follow it. it is just me.. and I have run empty now. I do not even have steam to keep me going, just a void where I used to be.

I have let people do such horrible things to me, because I deserve it. nightmares have haunted me for so long that, I wake up screaming or crying most of the time. I would keep inviting it too, because even abuse means someone is there keeping you alive in some way. I know I'm unhealthy, but that goes with being sick.

I do not know what else to say.. I was just talking, but even that had fatigued me now.",depression

I wasn't the best with emotions of people that time but atleast I was happy and functional. I have tied my worth to a lot of things which I no longer have. That, made me question worth relentlessly. I think everyone deserves to be happy despite everything in life, but I can't say it to myself. All conditions are different for myself. I deserve to starve if I don't do well, I deserve to not meet anyone if I messed up somewhere, I deserve to be treated like shit. 

It took me a while to realise how I came to accept being treated badly by people. I am ""working on myself"" but will I ever be able to get my old self back? No. I'm stuck with a version of myself who cares about everything except herself and it fucking sucks.",depression

In this personality I literally feel like unaliving people as if I would really enjoy it. It's getting so bad now that others have started to notice. Am I becoming a psychopath? What can I do?

20824,"  I'm not in the best of state (mentally). Sitting around doing school or on the phone, pretty much spending my life in my room. My biggest problem in life is no motivation. I have a lot of trouble getting my school done. Sometimes I get so far behind that thing start to go crazy.                     
  Drawing off point here. So I get these bizarre periods of depression. Lasting from 3 to 12 hours, one time it lasted for 2 days. And when I get like this I don't eat, sleep, or talk to anyone. I get these strong urges to end my life; convincing myself that it's the right thing to do. Calling myself a coward if I somehow failed in the past.                         
  But the truth is........
  I'm scared 
  I'm scared that one day it will get so bad that I'll actually kill myself. I try to find ways to slap myself out of my depressed states. Calm myself down and try to relax. Maybe go outside for a walk. 
 My parents and siblings really don't take mental illnesses seriously and I have no way of seeing a therapist. I really don't know what to do. I don't want to die. But I lose my common sense when I'm depressed. Is there some way around it? or maybe a way of convincing my family that it's a problem? Is it to much to ask for help?",depression

In the past two weeks, my teenager in crisis has needed much more support than usual, which is incredibly draining and stressful for me despite the fact they have a good team in place.

28 y/o adderall, caffeine, kratom addict living/renting from divorced parent &amp; step parent. 

Tumultuous childhood, regularly bullied/beaten by older sibling. Parents fought viciously on a regular basis. My personality lost all semblance of normalcy at age 5. From then on out, I saw the world around me as a threat. It only got worse after school when I accelerated my drug use. My older sibling killed themselves when I was 19, and that sent me over the edge. I pushed everybody away. Now I'm alone &amp; I swear it feels bloody impossible to have relationships like I used to.
I live a vicious cycle of working a to earn a little money so I can spend it on drugs which enables me to tolerate work. I'm not getting anywhere. I'm going nowhere, slowly.

I have a vacation coming up (first one in 15 years). 2 weeks in a tropical destination as a birthday gift from a loved one. I think I'm gonna use it to get off drugs so I can fially move forward in my life. Cause right now I'm seriously not having a good time. I feel like this is my last chance to turn things around before my life devolves fully into chaos and I'll feel like it's necessary to clock out and leave.

20618,"Any advice or suggestions on what I should do? He's 19, dropped out of college because he have no passion in anything. He hates learning and have no friends. He's always in his room and refuse to leave. He would lock his door and turn off the lights. When my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them. Sometimes when we come back home and I check up on him, he told me he regretted it and said he's a horrible person.

I suggested him to get professional help. I'm also seeing a therapist to try to better myself. But my brother told me it's a waste of time and he doesn't want to talk about his feelings. All he does is play pc games from morning to night. Even till 3 am. My mom comes home from her night shift and when she saw that he's still awake they started a screaming match. Their loud voices would wake me up and I try to stop them and it never works.

Now I just check up on him and try to have a decent conversation with him. I would talk about video games with him or other things he's interested. But most of the time he yells at me to leave his room.

I think he has a lot of pressure from my mom. She wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field. It might be partially my fault too. My mom wanted me to be a nurse but I got a degree in art. Even my relatives told me ""you can't have 2 siblings in the creative field. There has to be a balance. Your brother should be in stem."" I asked my brother and he actually wants to be a writer. I feel bad, I don't think I'm a good older sister (I'm 25). I focused on my own issues for a long time now. I also tried defending him against my family but he told me to stop. My brother ended up yelling at me that I'm a failure because it took me 6 years to graduate, got a useless degree and tons of job rejections. So he doesn't want to take any advice from me about college. He always tells me this when he wants to be alone because I ended up crying to my room or the bathroom.",depression

20578,"You go out into the world because you have to. You spend the whole day trying to muster the energy to be social and push past your social anxiety. You know you still don't have the sufficient social skills or enthusiasm about life necessary to be attractive to women, but you persist with this life anyways, trying to learn what you can from the men you see around you who seem happy, able to confidently express themselves, who bring good vibes, who have something to say, and are interesting. And then inevtiably you look at where you are in life. What you know, what you are like. You are trying to change, but it's not working really. You try to have a real interest and love for things in this world, but it is not coming naturally. Due to whatever mental or developmental reason you constantly forget about the things you try to learn about. Moat of your brainpower is being used trying your hardest to be socially acceptable and not seen as an awkward teenager in an adult's body. Constantly thinking about self presentation and body language, always knowing that it is your outward presentation that largely impacts your opportunities in life.

And at the end of the work day you come home. You are exaughsted, but your job doesn't pay well. So you are supposed to use the time after work to study and work towards a better future. But you feel beaten down and tired when you get home. You can barely muster the energy to work out. If you do, it takes forever because you are tired and you can't focus. And if you are me, a day spent among the socially competent and likable is enough to send you into a negative thought spiral. Googling about how to improve social skills, feeling tired when you read about what you have to do. You are already tired. It is a compounding tiredness. You know it isn't your sleep or your diet. Both of those are in check. It's just life. A life that you are having trouble with feeling enthusiastic about in the first place.

Every day, the nagging thought that you will always be alone is ever present in the back of your mind. You can't stop thinking about those women who you did not have a choice but be attracted to romantically. Not in a very heavy way. They were just someone you actually wanted to shoot your shot with. And you know you failed with these women. And during the time you knew them, you sat and watched as the aforementioned likable, charismatic men of the world easily swooned them, entertained them, freely loved them, and their love was accepted. And you look at that and see that you are not like them. You will never be like those men. You can try every day to painstakingly get there.

You can try as hard as you can to relax and be a fun person to be around, but you never quite reach that state of being. You often wonder if you are not mentally/cognitively capable of being like those men. And you realize that all of this is making you tired still. In addition to feeling essentially doomed to be alone in this world, you are confronted with it's relentless challenges, and you wonder, what is the point of it all? Is this life worth living? Is there a reason to smile when you are the kind of person that you are in this world, and you can't seem to really change despite your absolute best effort, which you painstakingly put in every day, only to return to the same sad, tired state at the end of the day? It's difficult to get excited for life, when you feel socially incapable and generally unlovable. When you feel unable to bring value to other people as a friend, as a companion.

Another day wasted. A day of work is to be followed by a day of work towards a better life, for which there doesn't seem to be any energy. My mind is tortured with the thought that I am not fundamentally a good enough person to be with. This thought never goes away. I will always be alone.",depression

20476,"So, my prior job turned extremely toxic back in November due to new management. It devastated my (already shitty) mental health. In January I couldn’t take it anymore so I quit. I’m 42 years old and I have a mortgage and I live alone with my dog. There’s no money coming in and my house payment is 23 days late. 

I’ve tried getting a new job, but due to my depression, I can barely make myself go to the mailbox and get the mail more than once per week. I’ve only left my house once in the last 2 months. I’ve had 2 interviews lined up but I couldn’t make myself go. 

So, a couple weeks ago I had the idea to start a business. I failed to get any investors, so I said fuck it and started using my credit cards to buy the tools and equipment I need. 

I’m currently just about out of money, and I’m nowhere near ready to start the business. Making and selling things, basically is the business model. 

I’ve been really starting to feel the full weight of this decision and the pressure to not fail is insane. I don’t know what to do if I fail.

I’ve had plenty of suicidal thoughts since back in November, but I was able to push them away. My dog and my dad (he lives in another state and has health issues and he’s pushing 80) are the only things keeping me from swallowing the old bottle of ambien in my cupboard, pulling my car into the garage, and just letting it all go.

The part of me that wants to live is getting smaller everyday. I’ve discussed all this with my therapist and one friend, but even then I have a habit of sugar coating things. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel broken and empty inside. Out of nowhere I’ll just break down and cry. I can’t remember the last time I thought “hey maybe things are gonna be ok”. 

I guess that’s the end of my rant. Thanks for reading this far. Take care, everyone!",depression

20230,"I'm struggling atm. Not as bad as I have been previousy, however, my logical mind seems to be undermining me. Everywhere I go it feels like people only want relationships that have a transactional value. The person that I am doesn't matter, lots of people can't understant even basic concept regarding lots of things, yet I seem to understand them fine. For instance 'giving without receiving' seems to be something the majority of people can't understand. I try and find communities, but my values of 'trying to not inflict suffering' and looking at the world in way that is communitive rather than idividualisticseems to be considered 'extreme'. The only friends I had made since I got sober verbally and physically abused  me, and the other people didn't stand up for me and then acted like nothing happened after I lost my home due to it.   


I tried to go to the buddhist center for guidance as it seems most inline with a lot of my beliefs, but there wasn't a proper teacher there and very few members. I need some help with human contact. How to find a group that isn't so polarzed it creates echo chambers and also not so un-aware it is detrementle for mental health.   


I volunteer, I go to the gym. I'm fit and healthy (except for my mind atm, and even then, it's because I live in a world where I see all the death and hatred and how easy it couldbe different, so possibly understandable)   


I would just like to beleive that I am not invisable. That I matter to someone somewhere. But I don't. If I died right now it would be an inconvenience because someone else would have to stop what they were doing to clean up and post an add on roomshare

I feel like I spent so much time learning buddhism and stoicism just to be confronted by a world that is incredibly selfish and doesnt want me in it. And I understand this is black and white thinking, and I understand this isn't the entire planet, but it's the world that is available to me, and the possibilities are lacking",depression

20803," 

A guy in the tail end of high school liked a girl who was his classmate so much but did not ask her out because they were friends. Also, the guy had low self-esteem. After they were close and sometimes flirted but nothing serious, they continued to be friends through college even though she studied out of town. Every time she goes back home, they hang out.

During college, the guy majors in chemistry, and during the third year, he got depressed and caved into pressure and had a panic attack due to not catching up in school and the idea that he is a failure to his parents. That resulted in him not going to school anymore. He did this in secret throughout the semester, so when the next semester is up, his parents discovered that he stopped going to school and instead wandered around town and wasted time in LAN cafes. During this incident, he cut off all communication with his friends and acquaintances. He was lonely during this time. After his family discovered the incident, his family already saw him as a failure, and it was clear from their eyes and the way they treated him. This got him more depressed and ashamed.

At some point, he realized he had lost the motivation to do anything productive. He did not know when it started, so he pondered and remembered when he was last motivated and realized that it was only because of his friends back then. Then he thought back to his childhood and realized he would rather not try to do anything because if he made a mistake, he would be punished. And if he did good, then nothing. Maybe he was not motivated at all because he was raised in a negative punishment methodology of parenthood. He blamed his parents for the things that he was, but he also realized that his parents did everything to provide for his needs except for the needs of warmth and recognition. He was conflicted.

His parents asked him to go to school after the school year ended, and he accepted. As he was ashamed of what he did, he studied in another town. During his studies, he realized that he could not make any meaningful connection with anyone at all. He realized again he was lonely.

During this second chance of studying, he heard news about the girl he liked, and he felt things. When it was good news, he was happy. When it was bad news, he was concerned. One of the guy's high school friend's fathers died, and he saw her again. It was weird. He realized he loved her and he now only loves the idea of her, a type of obsession of pain, as every future that the guy saw was with her. But she is now in a happy relationship, and the guy she is in a relationship with is great, and the guy thinks that they would be married, and the guy also thinks it's good for them to be married.

 After graduation, the guy returned to his hometown but remained unemployed. He felt lost and uncertain of what to do next. He often thought of his past mistakes and regrets, including not pursuing the girl he had feelings for and not taking his studies seriously.

As time passed, he became more and more discouraged. He didn't have the motivation to pursue any opportunities that came his way, even those that could have helped him grow and develop his skills. He spent most of his days alone, feeling like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of hopelessness and despair.

Despite the encouragement of his friends and family, he continued to feel like a failure. He couldn't shake the feeling that he had let everyone down, including himself. He knew that he needed to make a change, but he didn't know where to start.

The future was uncertain, and he didn't know what would happen next. But he knew that he couldn't give up, even when things seemed impossible. He would continue to search for a way out of his current situation, hoping that one day he could find his way back to a brighter future.",depression

20911,"This has probably talked about so many times on here but I don’t know where else to turn to about this. I so deeply wish I was terminally ill or had cancer. I want a time limit on my life as I’ve just given up, I’m not healing and I’m not declining, I don’t want to kill my self but I’m not exactly happy and thriving either. If I had a time limit I can at least try and enjoy before I have to go, and I don’t have to let people down by killing myself. If I had the option I would rot in my bed but I keep pushing, maybe one day things will get better, I’m not even a quarter way through my life, I don’t want people upset or disappointed in me either. But each second I feel my body just weighs more and more to the point I can’t even lift my arms, and not in the physical sense but life is just a struggle now and being I’ll would be a great reason, a great excuse. If I had cancer I wouldn’t even do chemo, I would just accept my fate. I just want this to be over and done with, I’d be less afraid too. I’m horrified of death, losing my conscious and it being able to happen at any moment, but if I knew I’d have a timer, things would seem much more easier.",depression

20364,"Hey everyone this is my first Reddit post lol. Anyways I’m currently in my first year of college in a big city. I’ve lived in a little town my whole life so the city itself is very overwhelming. I have adhd, many forms of anxiety, depression (obviously lol) and a slew of other mental disorders. I failed every class last semester mostly because I had a rough break up, and I thought at the beginning of the semester I’d do better. Which in a way I sorta did I’ve been taking more notes and stuff, but I’ve really been working on myself as a person more, and for a while a lot of my anxiety symptoms have been going away, but today I had a talk with my parents where they mentioned how I’d need to show them my grades and boom all of a sudden I’m back in my shitty little hole of overthinking. And yet again it looks like I might fail. I feel that college isn’t for me, but if I do t do college then what will I do for work I don’t wana live with my parents again, they are great but I need my space. I feel that I can’t be happy and get good grades, I don’t want to be who I am anymore I see a version of myself that I can be proud of but I need to work more towards it and I can’t do that and keep going to school because it’s too expensive. And socializing is hard enough for me so if I’m not on campus with people of similar age to me how will o ever find a person I want to spend my life with. I really dislike online dating but I’m worried that’s the only what I’ll find someone if I leave here I’m a hopeless romantic and I want to find someone in real life, like a meet cute or whatever they are called. Not to mention that I feel like a huge disappointment because no line of work really speaks to me, I want a job I’ll be happy in and will allow me to like a comfortable life. I honestly have no idea what I’d want for the future, all I want is a comfy house with a spouse who loves me and I’d be happy, but I don’t see that happening at all. I’ve got 2 frequents and neither of them can just listen to my problems without giving me their own experiences wich is nice but I wish they’d just shut up and listen. I don’t really want to die I just want to sorta fade out of existence, like being in a dream. I know death isn’t the right thing, I don’t want my family to have to burry me I just want these feelings to be quiet; I want to know that somewhere down the line I have the safety and love I dream of every night. I really don’t want the people I love to have to suffer but I can’t tell if life’s worth it. I know every one says oh it gets better but I’ve waited for it to get better for most of my life and guess what it’s not getting better. Ugh I really don’t care if no one reads this I just need red to think someone has heard me. And hey if you got through all that I deeply appreciate you, I hope you are having a better time than me lol.",depression

20398,"I (22,F), lost my mom 4 years ago, and my dad 9 years ago. All my siblings have their own lives. I have four friends who happen to be busy with their own lives as well. Never had a boyfriend. I just started working as a MedSurg nurse a month ago and I absolutely hate it. My mom was also a nurse, my dad was a doctor. I did it for them, now they’re gone. Didn’t even have the chance to attend my graduation. It’s downhill ever since my parents died. Been depressed ever since. 

I drive to work every day wishing I’d never arrive. Like fantasizing a car crash. Patients, doctors, and supervisors treat us new nurses like crap. It’s demoralizing and dehumanizing. It’s an extremely thankless job, and that includes terrible pay. Our ratio is 1:10. I go home crying after every shift. I’m on a three-month probation, and I wanna quit. Don’t know how much of this shit I could take. Before my parents passed away, I was supposed to go med school after finishing undergrad, now there’s no way I could afford med school on my own. I just feel like a failure and hopeless every day. I can’t remember the last time I felt genuinely happy. I feel like I’ve been a decent human being my whole life and life rewards me with dead parents, a horrible job, and no support system. 
So sorry for venting here, I just don’t have anyone to talk to about all of these :(",depression

20268,"I need to submit a 4-page paper in the next 4 hours, otherwise, I would fail my class. but instead, I'm here to vent about how much I hate life in general and in particular and in every way possible.

but mostly, I hate me. This paper, for example, was due on Monday. it is Friday and I still haven't written a single page. and no, I wasn't busy. I was just being my procrastinating self. it is also 4 am and idk if I can have the energy to type anything down.

Oh and also, this is not the first time this happened. I ALWAYS do this whenever I have a deadline coming up. always leaving things till the very last minute and always ending up doing a shitty job because of that. 

now, my problem with life isn't really about my inability to submit assignments on time, it is more about how fucked up I am as a person. whenever I fail to perform any form of task normally, I would get drowned in thoughts wondering why I am the way I am.

all I do is cry myself to sleep, stress eat and procrastinate. like that's literally my cycle of life. 

Feeling shitty about my lack of disciple quickly becomes feeling shitty about the lack of love in my life, and how I have the shittiest parents who neither wanted me to exist nor knew how to love me. and how I at this 22 years of age, have not experienced a single moment of love with anyone ever, and how I am so touch deprived and how much pain I feel on a regular basis. 

this. mfing. pain. I never thought that being very mentally fucked would result in me feeling physically hurt from how much mental load I'm carrying?

like as if a fucked up brain and a none existing self-esteem and self-worth are not enough...

anywaysss, wasted enough time here. imma go submit whatever the fuck I can and put myself into a coma for the weekend so I don't feel a thing, I hope. 

no but wait I just remembered how I am also incapable of finding peace in my own dreams lmfao.

I have no particular circumstantial problems, traumas etc in life, yet I feel like absolute shit. I feel like I'm cutting myself just to shoehorn myself into a community and feel like I have a problem, so that I can blame all my shortcomings and failures on that ""mY dEpReSsIoN"" instead of owning them up like a normal functioning adult and improving. But noooooo I waste everything I have, all the resources at my disposal, and its funny because I actually am disposing them down the drain lmao. I am just acting things out in this elaborate drama I have constructed for myself so that I can feel like a victim of my own imagination, make up problems where there aren't any, and poach resources away from those actually suffering. 

You know I sometimes take a blade to my hand but I get scared. I get terrified, that probably is a primal instinct. That definitely means I am faking it all, right. If I really hated myself and wanted to kms, I'd be able to sink it deeper, with no regards to the pain. But noooo, all I can do is barely see the white.  Because if I was really wanted to kms, I'd have something to show for it. If I'm really suffering, I should've been able to cut deeper just to deal with the ""emotional pain"" that I apparently have. But wait, I can't slide-and-dice deeper - if everything in my life is all fine and dandy, yeah that's right. I'm a fraud. I can't, so that clearly shows I'm not in pain. can't even get a drop out. I'm a fucking fraud 

How do people do it. Deal with the pain and just slice away down deeper. I wanna be able to do it. I'm fake as fuck.

20058,"When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled. And I know working out would make a much bigger difference to my mood right now than writing this post, but I'm sick of everything. Why does life insist on being such a shit show?

Update: After writing this, briefly texting with a redditor, who was kind enough to reach out to ask if I'm okay and feeling my feelings for a bit (aka crying), I put on my workout clothes and got it over with. It didn't do much right then and there, but I also went to bed on time, to get a proper night's rest and I woke up feeling a little better. So, up and onwards I go until the next time I veer off track  managing myself. Because there really isn't an alternative.

20525,"Just my personal observations. I’ve been in the mental health sphere a long time, diagnosed with depression over 20 years ago when I was a young teen.

Social media these days seems to give a lot of attention to anxiety-related illnesses, especially post-Covid. Absolutely justified and nothing wrong with it, but I hear many more people say they have social anxiety/panic attacks/GAD symptoms vs. classic depression. I see it in advertising. And in my own circle as well. Maybe it’s just where I live? My age? 

I’m fortunate to not have both like some do, I just can’t relate and I feel like my friends/family/acquaintances with anxiety just can’t fathom what it’s like to JUST. HAVE. DEPRESSION.",depression

20863,"Back when I was in high school I was struggling to make friends and didn't have the greatest of home lifes either (my parents argued all the time and at times when they had no form of release for their anger and frustration I would end up their verbal punching bag or in extremely rare cases, physical action would be taken as well). Back then I was on a constant mental decline due to loneliness and solitude I constantly found my self in. In order to try and combat it I did theater programs run through my school. The high school I was at is know for their theatre programs as well as their music department. Though run by about 3-4 teachers, the school was known for how much it did within the field. the shows had thousands of dollars spent on them each year, the music students took trips to music competitions, with everyother year taking them to a competition in NYC. I loved theatre, even did quite well in it up until I was about 21, but it wasnt the environment of the school that got me into it. It was the fact that all the students seemed to friends with each other. Casts of the school shows seemed like familys at times and with my home life the way it was, I wanted something like that. So I joined the select choir, that led to me being subtly hinted at to audition for the schools shows (well, as subtle as people in that field could be). I did so hoping to join the family they created and got into the shows and was a part of the cast every year. now long story short I was never accepted fully into their family, it was those teenage years where they had already determined friend groups, but it allowed me time away from home for as many hours as possible. So some days with rehearsals or performances I would be at the school starting at 7 am until 11 pm. So I dedicated myself to the shows, they were the one thing that really kept me going. Cut my senior year, I was known for being a bad student amongst my peers. I never did homework because I would be too depressed at home to do it, so many teachers would yell at me in front of other students in attempts to get me to improve my habits. None of it worked though, mostly due to the fact that test scores could easily out weigh a students homework score to create a passing grade and with me never really getting below a 90 percent on any test, it led me to focus on theatre instead. I loved it at this point, the fall semester I was planning to audition for colleges and try to make a career out of this. Not only that but my school vocal director, who doubled as the musical director, chose a show we were gonna be dumping money into. I mean I think the show spent around 200k, fabrics imported for India, a large bell was made so it could be rung on stage without making a sound, costumes rented from the former professional touring production, it was a lot. I was excited for the year, my fellow seniors were all really talented and it felt like for once I had a piece of the future to look forward to, even if it was only 6 months worth of future. It didn't last long though. before the call back list was posted one day many of us were hanging out in the vocal directors classroom, one girl was sitting behind the desk of the director since it was the most comfortable chair there when she started going though some of the directors things. When pressed about it she said she was looking to see if her boyfriend at the time had made it into the show, if he didn't then she'd have to do her senior show without him. Another guy started to help her out of what I could only assume to be a mixture of bordem and curiosity when they stumbled apon a mock call back list as well as peoples rating for their auditions. the guy realized that they shouldn't be doing this and backed away to talk to others while the girl looked around asking others to look at it all for her. I wanted friends, so I did. I told her that her boyfriend had a good audition and when other students pressed me about out it, we talked about the call back list. The director eventually found out that people were going through her desk and when she asked other students about it, they all said I had done it in search of the call back list. None of them said that anything about the other two students, they didn't tell her how I just read out what they had found, they placed everything on me. I don't know why they all did this, I dont think I ever will, but it led to the director to looking to see if I had done anything else. Apparently at this point other students had claimed that I said that a girl wasn't in the call back list and it saddened her to the point of tears, first off that was wrong because I distinctly remember saying that she had a damn good chance to get the leading role along with everyone else on that list for it. She was and still is extremely talented and I've never claimed anything else. Next these students said I read the transcript of a math class for another student and bullied them for it. Now with this, I did read this transcript, the student had left it out on a table in the vocal classroom for about 2-3 weeks and one day I picked up and read it, made a comment about to to other students in the room, and put it back on the table it was. Unknown to me at the time, that student had dropped out, hence why he never came to retrieve the paper and why itd been there so long. I know the entirety of that situation because I had reached out to him to apologize when people started to blame me for him dropping out. He told me it was fine and didn't know what was happening because he made and followed through on that decision far before any of this happened. Unfortunately for me though the director only heard that the student dropped out, and that I according to others had bullied him. She pulled me aside one day to tell me how disappointed she was in me, she told me how she knew everything I'd done and that there's no reason to attempt to lie about anything. She said I was the reason that kid dropped out and that I robbed her of the chance to save him, she said I violated her trust by going through what must have been all of her things to find the audition information, and she said that she couldn't believe I would lie to people and tell others that a girl wasn't up for a role where she really was. I didn't know what to do, the director what certain in what she knew and I knew she wasn't changing her mind on any of it, so I just through tears said I was sorry, that I didn't mean to hurt anyone. The director was like a mother to me and now she was pinning all these things to me and I didn't know what to do. So as punishment she wanted me to apologize to the girl, I was to never be in her classroom without her being there, and that she couldn't in good faith help me with any college auditions. She finished it all off by saying that because of this all she didn't know if she could ever trust me again. It broke me, I isolated myself for the rest of the school year, she thankfully still let me be in the show that year, but I tried to not talk to many people at rehearsals if I wasn't spoken to first. I applied for other degree fields at colleges. And outside of school I rarely spoke to anyone unless it was online gaming. 
I didn't perform for over year after that, I couldn't get myself to be near a stage. I eventually got the courage to audition for the theatre department at the college I attended and got in. But after a year and a half the anxiety of being around a stage and performing, and the anxiety that I would just be someone's scape goat or disappointment again led to major problems for me. I developed a severe panic attack and anxiety disorder, and my body would start literally breaking down under the stress of it all, leading at points to trips to the ER for internal bleeding. I quit performing for good after that, I haven't been on a real stage since I was 19, and I haven't performed since I was 21. I'm 23 now and I don't know what to do, I had to drop out of college because of my mental health, my father has threatened to kick me out of the house because my choice to leave school and when my mother opposed his idea, threatened to divorce her and list me as the cause.im stuck in a deadend job working 60 hours a week and I've lost all will to do anything. I don't know what to do, I've lost everything and have no one. I just wanted friends and ended up here. I have a therapist but even after sessions I just leave feeling empty.

I need your guidance for what to do with my life. 
I need someone to talk to. My life is a disappointment. 

I want to give back to my parents, what I am now is because of them. It hurts me seeing them getting old as time goes by.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core. 

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss waking up excited. I miss caring. I miss eating with people. I miss being motivated. I miss having a purpose. I miss having a goal.

20352,"I (f18) have been diagnosed with depression some months ago, but I have struggled with it since 2019. It got particularly bad last year when my then boyfriend who was depressed aswell broke up with me. I was deeply depressed for months. I gave up everything that brought me joy, because I just had no energy. I didn't leave my bed, slept all day and stopped caring about my appearance (I had always been someone to enjoy fashion and makeup, so that was especially hard). I was heavily suicidal for a while, and it only got better when I started therapy. Life hasn't been exactly sunny since then either, but it got less bad. Since last week I have been feeling really down again. I returned to my bed, and I have difficulties to function normally again. My old fears have returned, and it feels like once again all joy has left my life. Today I felt suicidal again after a longer period of time of feeling somewhat ok. I feel so helpless.

20559,I just need to rant real quick. Everything sucks. I’ve been stuck in dpdr for about 2 years now. It’s been bad but it’s gotten worse. My home life hasn’t been great for a while now. My parents have been fighting a lot and recently told me they were going to divorce soon. My sister constantly degrades everyone in the house and will sit around all day and refuse to go to school. My mom is having work trouble. And my dad has kinda been the punching bag of it all. Fighting and yelling has become a regular occurrence. I cant stand it. I’ve been trying to keep myself together and come off as calm so maybe some stress could be taken off of everyone but I’m actually falling apart inside. My theory is if they see that I’m calm they will have one less thing to worry about. I’m always anticipating the next fight between any of the three and it sucks. I actually feel a sense of relief at school because atleast I’m away from all this. But schools not any better. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t recognize myself in the mirror. I don’t see me I see a shell. I want to get out and run away from everything. Im only 15 so that’s not an option though. Nothing feels real and I just don’t want to be here anymore. I just feel stuck and I have no one to talk to. Every time I would try to talk to my mom about my dpdr she would say I’ve been looking at the internet too much. I don’t want to talk to her about it because im scared she’ll say that again or explode from all the stress. She also dumps all her work problems on me and that just adds to the stress. I’m just scared. I don’t want them to divorce. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I don’t know how much longer I can hold it in. I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago and have meds but I’m so tired and drained that I can’t remember to take them. I just don’t know what to do anymore.,depression

Everything was out of place, my existence was wrong. Around 4 years after that, which is now, I started antidepressants. Idk if they really don't work and my body is fighting against them, or if I put myself in the “they don't work” mindset to the point they actually don't. But the first few weeks I was horrified of actually getting better. Now that the meds stopped working, I'm not panicking anymore. Starting treatment was my dream for so long, now I hate the idea of it. I find comfort in my sorrows. I got too deep into being helpless and accepted that I couldn't get out, so I decided to make it a safe space for myself. I don't know if I want to be better.

I used to be in shape, but I have relinquished that part of me as well since it serves no purpose anymore.

20962,"A plain and simple hi to begin

Most of this discussion will be off the top of my head and I'll be adding my own experiences.

To start, there are situations in life that we genuinely have absolutely no control over. I myself suffer from MDD and struggle with it on a daily basis. I take medication, I try and get out more, I see a therapist and I'm trying to find a job that would interest me. I'm constantly worried about my future and whether I want to continue or not. One thing that happens quite frequently is that I create non existent situations in my head which cause even more stress and anxiety. Once this cycle begins, it doesn't matter what it is, whether I have control over it or not, it's a nightmare to deal with this constant stress of anything that may happen. Why does this occur? Why are we as humans so unequipped to handle these challange? One could say the society we are surrounded by and what is expected of us causes a drastic change in the way we look, feel and think. To an extent this is true, but why is it so terribly exhausting and anxiety stricken to be able to even begin coping with what is going on around us. It's an obstacle I am incapable of clearing, I worry about anything and everything that involves me and those close to me. I'm consistently tired, in pain, anxious, worried and have had this heavy weight on my chest each and every minute of everyday for over 5 years. Nothing seems to change, I keep telling myself tomorrow will be different, I'll do this and that and it will all be better. But when the time comes.... I fall short, I let myself down, I let others down and most of all I continue the same cycle over and over again. Is this a situation or cycle I've made up to comfort myself as all I know is this feeling of dread and doubt and fear and anxiety, or does it truly exist and hinder me? Am I really my own worst enemy? Why am I constantly at war with myself? It feels like a never ending battle, I fight back, but I don't fight hard enough. Am I even capable of doing so?
Just what exactly is it that I'm waiting for... An idea, a person, an event or situation in my life? These consist of things I can and can't control... I feel as though I have no control over the majority of these things, which further pushes me to feel as though I have control over nothing. Why do we have to suffer the way we do? Why are our minds and body working against us? Is it not the job of our brain to keep us alive and well? It's supposed to keep us alive for as long as possible, and we even have built in ways of surviving dangerous situations, but when it comes down to the core of it, our brains are what control us. Our thoughts, our actions and feelings.... Yet its perfectly happy with the idea of us ending it...",depression

20000,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression

20816,"I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. Even when I was young, I wasn’t really happy. Anyway, I was diagnosed in my early twenties. I have learned how to live with depression, how to alleviate it etc. 
I haven’t really been to therapy a lot, for several reasons. Lately, I don’t have the energy for most things. I can barely make it through the day. I have deadlines and things to do and I really really want to get out of this vicious cycle and get better. But every now and then, I completely lose hope. I don’t really want to die, because despite everything I maintain my optimism that things can and will change. 
But in the meantime… how am I supposed to function to get there? Change only happens with actions. I don’t have the energy. I’ve lost all motivation. 

My main problem these days is: what’s the point? I see what’s going on in the world and everything is going to shit. People are fake as fuck. The only things that matter to society are extremely superficial. I don’t understand how people function in this society. 

It’s probably also helpful to mention that my home life is an epic disaster. I had to move in with my parents because I don’t work currently (thank you depression) and for the past year and a half, they have been in a pre-separation mode that they won’t conclude. I think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves. My mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life. My dad is a narcissistic liar who won’t deal with the truth. My siblings are pretty toxic and I am the one that they all depend on for emotional support. The thing, no one is really there for me. 

Anyway. This was a rant I needed to let out because I don’t really have anyone to vent to. I don’t want to burden my boyfriend with my depression, he doesn’t deal well with it. I don’t want to tell my friend about this because they have their own problems and we barely ever get to talk (they all live abroad). I rarely meet people who understand me. 

Can anyone relate to my story?",depression

20940,"Hello, 

I am male and twenty years old and actually I have a great life: I have great parents and a brother, I was successful in sports until my injury and I finished school very successfully a few years ago. In the meantime I have also almost finished the first part of my studies and I am successful there as well. In addition, I have a great - albeit small but fine - group of friends.

Somehow I have been feeling weak and tired for some time now and can't really motivate myself to do anything. I think a lot, especially about the past.

My school days were difficult at the beginning because I was bullied. I am almost highly gifted and always had difficulties to get into a really casual conversation with other people. Also, I had different interests than kids my age. After I changed schools, the situation was immediately better and I had made real friends for the first time and also developed self-worth. I just went through with school and left all the dating stuff alone, following the motto ""Will come around then, I have time"".

At the same time, it was always difficult in my family, too. My depressed and schizophrenic grandmother hates my parents, even though she lives next door to them. The whole thing goes so far that she says things like she would rather be dead than live next to people like my parents. 

Because I moved out to study, I was able to escape this somewhat, but it still depresses me because I am her only confidant.

Some time ago I tried dating and was only disappointed and hurt. I had not thought that rejection offends me so much. However, I have always been able to pick myself up again after recovery periods and continue. Then, about two and a half months ago, I met a girl - completely unexpectedly and unfortunately online - who completely enchanted me. And vice versa as well. She doesn't live quite nearby, but I have no problem with having to drive and it's not so far that we can't see each other every weekend. We then had together after a few meetings also our respective first kisses and now just look where the journey goes....

This feeling that I can actually be attractive and appealing is indescribable to me. And I have noticed how much I have always missed physical closeness the last few years, although I NEVER wanted to admit it and have always denied. 

The whole thing triggers a total existential crisis for me and throws me off track: Everything I have lived for the last few years now seems useless and disgusts me. I read my resume and am disgusted by the stringing together of courses, successes and professional experiences. I feel bad because for the last few years I've always laughed at couples for not getting the rest of their lives together. I feel bad because I've always tied my self-worth to achievement and now I see and feel that that's not actually what it's worth living for. But that it is love that one should live for.

Am I depressed and do I need professional help? My problem is that as a future civil servant I could then have problems with the medical officer and then no civil service relationship could come about. Do you have similar experiences or tips on how I should best deal with this?",depression

20772,"The pandemic ruined my mental health. I can’t get out of bed and i cant sleep at night. I feel so unloved. I hate my life so much but im such a coward. I just want to be dead. I hate myself so much. This is the worst it’s ever been and it’s only getting worse. My meds arent working, group therapy has never helped, the hospital made me worse, my mom and stepdad lost my trust by screaming at me. 

Im so lonely i have no one around me. My “friends” never fucking reach out it’s always me. Im getting sick and tired of waking up. Part of me wants to get better because i feel so awful, but im in a cycle and i have lost all motivation. I just wish something would kill me so i dont have to go through doing it myself. Im just so afraid ill be put in some other program that wont help me that i hardly ever tell what im feeling.

I had so much potential. I had straight A’s, i wanted to work and go to college. My grades have lowered, ive stopped going to school and instead i cyber and just cheat on all my courses because it’s easier than focusing. I got out of bed, i didnt nap all day. i was in therapy, but i was getting better and only had episodes around once a year. They happen a few times a month. 

Nothing helps, im broken. I just shouldnt be alive. My arms are so scared up, i have big red ones and they are so embarrassing. Ive hardly seen anyone with ones like mine. I just cant stop cutting.

I thought seeking an autism diagnosis would help, but since ive been diagnosed its been worse. My mom immediately said i was using it as an excuse. My mom and stepdad never ever tried to adapt to my sensory issues or even read about how they could help me. They just expect me to do all the work and all they do is find programs to put me in or dictate my appointments. Every time ive discussed something i didnt like that they do they have never tried to stop. They only listen in therapy.

There is no point to being alive if climate change is going to kill us all anyway. Nothing anyone says will ever make me feel better. Im doomed.",depression

20617,"These last 5 years have taken such a toll on me, that I just don't have the will to go on. My father was never in my life much, and my mother was more interested in alcohol and weed than myself and brothers wellbeing. The only paternal support we've really had is from our grandma. She has always done what she thought was best for my brother and me,, though she wasn't always able to give us the emotional support we needed. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was a teenager, and never had any sense of self worth or respect. The friends I had were their for convenience,  we shared some similar hobbies, and I was willing to do whatever they needed if that meant we could hang out. When I was 22, I started hanging out with a kind of bad crowd. We mainly got high and went to festivals and got drunk downtown. There were fun moments, but eventually an incident happened at a festival and I stopped hanging out with them. I did coke for the first time at this festival, and they all left me alone for the day. Afterwards, I stopped hanging out with them, more so out of getting my head straight, but none of then reached out to ke. Even to this day. I still see them from time to time around town, and they've all moved on to become better updmstanding people. Still hanging out together. Without me. After that happened I focused on work, did a bit of job hopping, started being healthier, lost a ton of weight (I was obese from middle school up to 23), and eventually my brother and i moved out into another apartment together with our grandma. He soon met a woman and got married, and they moved into their own place, so it was just me and my grandma. I did eventually meet a girl, and after a year I also moved into a place with her when I was 26. It was good for awhile, but her mom hated me. I wasn't extremely religious. I'm not against it in any way, but I don't need a book to tell me how to be a good person. She judged me from our first meeting, especially since I didn't come from a good stable background. I'm glossing over a lot but it had a significant impact on our relationship. We live there together for 1 year. I don't know when it started, but we would get into these intense arguments. She had a lot going on with her family and job,  and along with covid and isolation, the stress was too much for us to work through. After 7 months of living together we broke up. I left the apartment and went back to my grandmas place. We tried to stay friends, but I've realized that the changes in her personality have become too toxic for me. She knows my struggles with my insecurities, my depression, my anxiety, and even my family issues. Up until yesterday, she used that to manipulate me into being there for her emotionally. I kept struggling to break away, but she would bring up my past mistakes in our relationship and guilt me to continue being there for her. Anyways I went back to one of my old jobs, and was there until this past January. I left because I felt like I reached my peak. The customers were getting worse, we got a new manager who complete changed everything to their liking. I was overworked and felt undervalued. I didn't have a game plan, I just knew that for my mental health I needed to leave. Since then i havent found any kind of job. Since i left school, i dont hsve any qualifications except for retail, fast food, and other menial jobs. In the past year I gained back all the weight I lost. My body has been going through certain issues that I truly can't even afford to go to the doctor for. My grandma, bless her heart, hasn't  been too pushy about me finding a job. But I can see her irritation in her eyes. I know she's concerned about me isolating myself in my room. I don't even play games much anymore. I just waste my days browsing online, looking for jobs, and then just laying in bed thinking of my life. I have no one close around me. I have no friends, no SO, and I can't even talk to my brother about my depression. I know he's going through his own stuff, and he's tried to get me to play games with him but I feel like he should just focus on himself. The last two days I've been contemplating my life, my place in the world. I've come to the conclusion that I am just someone who doesn't belong. I'm not destined for a good life, not even an ok life. When I felt it was good it was ripped away from me, despite all my efforts to fix everything. I'm starting over from the bottom. Living with my grandma again. Overweight, jobless, and no real worth. I always felt so shityy for it, but I finally made my peace. I've struggled with suicide though a lot lately, I was afraid of actually going through with it because of my grandma and brother. Even my mommombit. I know they will be heartbroken, i know it will take some time for them to recover, but they will eventually. My grandma is so emotion strong, and my brother, while he will be more hurt from it, is also stronger than me emotionally. He also has his wife there to support him. We used to talk about suicide when things were bad, and he always said no matter what happened to us he would never be Ble to go through with that. I used to think I couldn't either....I guess I truly am a weakling. I know it'll be hard for them, but I feel that their lives will be so much easier once they don't have to worry about me anymore. I've made peace with it. They were the last things holding me back, but I don't feel worried anymore. They'll be able to live their lives when I'm gone, and I won't be a burden for them and for myself anymore. I'm exhausted. Every day is such a struggle to get up and try. Lately I've been having nightmares. They've gotten worse, and I feel this is the only way to stop. I'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of trying. I've accepted that I'm not meant for anything, and I've accepted I don't deserve happiness. I'm ready now. For the first time in 5 years I've bought some wine. I hate wine with a passion, but it aas on clearance and I just needed to get my head to stop thinking. Once she leaves for work tomorrowi think ill just drink myself stulud. I dont know whatll happen, maybe i wont go through wjth it, but this is the first time ive felt good about ending it. All i can think of is how itll be overoveri wont have to suffer anymore, i wont be a burden anymore. I wont be worthless anymore. Ill be forgotten, which i am ok with. If you took the time to read this I thank you wholeheartedly.  I know it's a bunch of ramblings, but it feels good to get it off my chest. I feel like with this I can take that step, and I will finally achieve peace. I hope if you read this, don't be like me. I am a weakling, but I hope you can use this to push on. Do what I couldn't do. I wish you the best of luck",depression

20177,"When do the tears stop. When does this empty feeling stop. When does the erge to selfharm stop. When does the pain stop. 
Im tired of crying myself to sleep and having no one to talk to about this. They see me happy one day and the following they try list all my triggers. 

I feel like the only reason i havnt killed myself is because of my sister. Shes the only one that understands why i take the pills. Shes the only one who asks how im going on a specific day. But again she is a child so i know i cannot burden her with these thoughts. And she cannot become the people i need her to be and her words are starting to sound like whispers compared to the screaming pain.

Everytime they bring up the pills it makes me feel even more useless than i already feel. Everytime I have to remind someone how to love me i somehoe loose the love i have for myself.

I am 2 yrs sober off booze which is an achievement but another earthly pleasure I cant have. Smoking is my only escape. I severely lack self discipline and am constantly ashamed of myself for it. I cant plan anything in my life or build any pathway, I live day to day like an animal.

20735,"I've been falling into a massive pit of dispair. I can't take meds for it because it counteracts other diagnosis. I have a therapy appointment on Monday I'm skeptical about going to for judgement. Im terrified of leaving the house and speaking to people just someone looking at me is enough to trigger a panic attack I've even been avoiding my housemates as much as possible. I talk to people online but I feel like I'm going crazy. Ive tried to stop myself from suicide 3 times in the last two weeks. Theirs no other help other than this free place I reluctantly arranged to go to. I'm overwhelmed with anxiety and paranoia. When people speak to me or look at me or breathe near me I wanna disappear as fast as possible. I'm thinking of wearing a mask and sunglasses to walk to the appointment on Monday so no one can recognize me or try to talk to me. Because people seeing me is my biggest issue. I don't understand why. But it's seriously affecting me I haven't left the house in many days. Barely been able to shower, brush my teeth, cook and working is just as hard but the only thing I've managed. Now the level of my paranoia is affecting my work. I wish I could just snap out of it.

I have always resented the thought of maybe I’m depressed because it feels like that’s become the norm every person and their dog brags or says they’re ‘so depressed’ and I just didn’t want to turn out like that 
The things I’ve said and done to people because I’m insecure make me hate myself and it was just for a couple of laughs with my friends I just hate myself but in a way there’s a sort of comforting feeling with how sad and shallow I feel 
The dumbest thing is I have nothing to be depressed or sad about other than maybe I’m lonely because I barely talk to anyone anymore 
Im sorry if this makes no sense it’s more of a vent than anything because I don’t know who else to go to or what to do with myself

I've fully accepted death although this is not a suicide note or an indication of one, I have previously attempted and for awhile felt no remorse or regret from doing so. And even now I wish I would've given it 100% as I feel I have no use or purpose and all I ever do is dissappint both myself and others, I am worthless. Nothing I jave ever done is fulfilling past the honeymoon phase of finding a new hobby, I never have the drive or discipline to keep at it I see the mountain I have to climb and it all seems so pointless to me. And I am left a failure again until I decide to do something else and fail once again. I don't deserve anything I have or anyone that is friends with me. I don't understand what other people see in me I wish even for a mpment I could see myself through their eyes because my own only hat and loath me.

20251,"Things started to go downhill once my dad got sick, and passed away. I lost my jobs due to Covid, and couldn't recover till the tail end of 2021. My grandpa had passed during 2021, and our house has started to fall apart. I work long hours, but still don't make enough to keep everything paid, even our property taxes. Now, a week away, the property tax offices are planning to take us to court and sue us for the debt we owe if we don't pay it by the 31st of this month, and they are also going to start legal proceedings on foreclosure. And when things started to get worse, our only car to go to and from work, and to go shopping and everything, broke down. Everything's piling on, and I'm just one guy. I've tried so hard to stay positive in the constant face of adversity, but I feel I am finally losing this battle again and again. Nothing has been going my way, and whether it's just bad luck or not, I don't know. I'm close to losing my job as well because of my absences, and I've nowhere else to turn. All of my coworkers and friends who have all told me ""I'm so sorry, let me know if I can help you!!"" go silent when I tell them exactly how they can help, ways and methods to help.. I am becoming bitter.. I'm gaining the mindset that they don't care what happens to me, but if they were in my shoes, they'd be crying and trying to fight just as much..

20655,"My mom died last Oct, I've been fighting legal battles with my stepbrothers that dropped surprise court papers on me that basically said fuck you in mid Dec. They were supposed to be filing an estate immediately but took their time until they conspired enough support and stolen everything they wanted. 

Last month the legal battles were supposed to be over, they withdrew, they are not over...

Just under a month ago I began the laborious task of moving 20+yrs of stuff with little to no help. The things the stepbrothers stole, like truck and trailer would of helped tremendously in moving and storage.

This last weekend I began swapping some of my mom's stuff out for mine and disposing of some of it. I moved half of it to the curb and kept back a working fridge and a couch.

Then I got sick, I'm still sick.

Garbage came Tuesday and still sick I halfheartedly worked on my mess...as the local neighbor rookie gun-hobcop drop by...he seen me working... I seen him see me.

Today I received a citation for non working appliances, ""it's a nuisance""...except they do work...well the fridge did. I ""removed"" the doors as the officer I called and spoke to advised. Then I proceeded to fill my sidewalk with ever single bit of stuff I don't want.

This same cop started dating a girl down the street last year at some point who recently turned 18...

Around this time my step dad died and mom had cancer, I was having financial troubles and gas was $5/Gallon. I asked on local Facebook pages trying to get a charger for my electric trimmer to no avail. Eventually my grass was exactly the height max allowed..in spots...so naturally this same cop took it upon themselves to send me a citation. When complaining about the citation on a local page I was told ""if I can't afford to mow my grass I should pay someone to do it"".........like wtf...

I just want to mourn my mother's death but even after months of struggling non-stop I can't take 2 days off to be sick. Fuck farmington il, fuck fpd, fuck Officer M. Carlock.",depression

20424,"I'm 24, I will be 25 in November, and I haven't done anything with my life.

I'm still at University because I reproved 3 years and I still got 3 more years (hopefully) to finish it. I have no friends much less a girlfriend, I used to hang out with my school friends (till about 2019) but nowadays all of them have moved on with their lives, at University I made no friends the first 2 years and now is impossible because everyone already knows each other so there is no ""get to know each other"" moments. 

Not only that, but because I fucked up so many times at University I lost access to the government grants and I must pay for University with my money which I don't even have because I don't have a job but even if I had one it wouldn't be enough.

I don't do anything the whole day nor do I talk with anyone, I haven't had a conversation with someone other than my family for about 3 years. I'm only eating once a day because I'm short on money, I hate going outside because I don't have anything to do but I can't even watch a movie or play a video game because is just not fun anymore, I often just keep opening and closing the movies or games.

**Now that I'm 24 I just feel way too old to do most things and feel like I don't fit anywhere. I'm not good looking and people just ignore me, I feel like I just missed the boat on developing social relationships and It's too late for me now.**",depression

20731,"Background - My brother is much younger to me and the youngest of four siblings. He has been dealing with depression and IBS since the age of 15. He is also suicidal when it gets worse. He is on psychiatric medications. We are a very dysfunctional family where my father turns everyone's life into hell to the extent possible. My mother has severe depression too. 

Current situation - So after two years of treatment my brother isn't getting any better. There are periods when he does fine but then relapses into depression. His IBS also gets worse and it bothers him a lot. He is in general very introverted and doesn't let anyone know what he is feeling except for occassional aggressive outburst where he is extremely angry and out of control for usual problems like his IBS.
My father is currently using financial abuse to torture my mother and brother who are financially dependent on him. But I am stepping up to help my brother financially and I tried counseling him and assuring him that I will take care of him no matter what. 
But his condition is not improving. He said he feels terrible that he is not able to be normal and do normal activities like going to college regularly or making friends etc. I told him that everyone's normal is different and he should work as per what feels good to him. That day he was fine for sometime but again withdrew to his room where he stays in complete darkness the entire time. It's been 5-6 days now. I have fixed a new psychiatrist's appointment for him and he agreed. But I want to know what else can I do in this situation. I want him to be fine and happy but nothing seems to work and he is 19 so we can't force him to do anything. Should I just let him take charge of his life and hope for him to get better? Or is there something more that I can do? No one else in our family is bothered or emotionally attached to him so it's just me. 
All advice would be helpful. Thanks!!",depression

20538,"Decided to use one of my many alt accounts and put it to work. My depression used to comes in waves and typically I could handle and channel it into art or music or something but recently this one I haven't been able to shake it and it's killed my productivity.  I don't know really what set it off I never do. But in it I've realized alot about myself amongst other things which makes me feel worse. Ill go through some but this ones a biggie.  For context I was dating a girl for a while (when it started i was like 15 and she was 18 going on 19) and she was allways emotionally abusive in some form but it all went down hill my junior year when I was 17 she started drinking more often and mixing her meds with it. Long story short she ghosted for like 3 or 4 months and when she did contact me it was pretty much to say she's dumping me and moving to Florida with a  ""friend"" she met in college who I have on good report she was cheating on me with. I still haven't emotionally recovered from that mess every negative thing that happened to me has left me afraid of a repeat in my next relationship. Since then my life got worse year after year and it's only just starting to stabilize again. One of those years though has left me blaming myself for getting my grandmother sick during covid leading to her death in 2021. There where other horrible events that lead me to here and now. On new year I decided to try to recapture how I use when I was 15. I was relatively happy I had confidence and drive to try to reach my dreams and personal goals and I had friends and people that loved me. But I cant all those aspects of me just don't last each time I mange to reclaim somepart of my former self something happens to destroy it and leave me worse off. In my attempt to reclaim something I've realized how far I've fallen behind people I considered friends and looked up to. They have great jobs they're  chasing their dreams forming families surviving on their own going to college and are making something of themselves and I'm still in our home town working at the local Casey's living in a spare room my stepfather and bio mother had no plans for. I'm not even sure they wanted me here they say they do but I know they didn't want a 20 year old moving inafter being kicked out. It's like no remnants of my former self exists if younger me could see me and realize how much I've changed for the worse he would beat me for wasting time and destroying what little attractiveness we had. I've always realized change was one of those things that are inevitable like death. I've always realized me from 6 years would be different from me now but I just always hoped it'd be for the better and not the worse possible thing to happen to me. The few people I've vented have always told me something about gods testing or he has a plan for me but fuck he must really despise me to make my grandfather (who I lived with from 1 to 20) an abusive drunk who loved yelling screaming and threatening me every chance he got till he kicked me out the day after Christmas put me in an abusive relationship let me get bullied horribly by almost everyone and take away one of the the few people I knew care for me and make her death be on my head. Change is a constant and I've been changed so much that in just I few years that I'm permanently altered  and the realization that I can't go back has hurt me far worse then any person can. Sorry to subject you to my ramblings I remembered doing this used to help me and I was hoping it would again but it hasn't. 
            Sorry for the bother-Mr.E",depression

20271,"I've been off my meds for a few months waiting for my health insurance to kick in. Finally get it on and I had to wait 2 months until April. They're so backed up. January I got rammed by a lady who tried to rush a yellow.

Tonight, I was going down the road at 38mph in a 40 zone, and the truck behind me kicked in his high Beams. The car ahead of me was about 5 car lengths up and decided to stop to turn and I didn't see it because I was being blinded by the bat signal behind me and I was trying to fiddle with the anti glare mirror. He stopped, no turn signal or any reason why, but I fucked up and slammed on my brakes. Hit him. I already had one set back this year. No collision coverage. I do for this one but I borrowed money to buy this car.

20400,"I’ve been depressed for about 4 years and it seems to have just gotten more severe as time goes on. I’ve tried loads of different supplement and antidepressants including methylated b vitamins, fish oil, zoloft, prozac, lexapro, buproprion, NAC, 5-HTP and more. Nothing has worked for me I’m still just as depressed and exhausted as I was when I began, actually even more now that it seems like it never goes away. My symptoms of depression are mainly fatigue, low motivation, low energy, and anhedonia/emotional blunting. This has me wondering could there be a root cause or something wrong with me that has caused these problems? My life is pretty good besides the issues that my symptoms give me, could I have a hormone imbalance or some other problem that causes this? I don’t want to be throwing medicine to mask my depression if there is some deeper reason for it. For all of you that seem to be depressed due to an issue within yourself have you done any testing or anything to find the root cause of the problem that helped ?

20964,"I (20M) have for the past 2 months been seeing a CBT therapists after struggling with mental health and depression for the last 3 years. A point that irked me was that I never could pinpoint the cause of my mental deterioration, so I assumed that my condition was just a result of an accumalation of bad experiences and circumstances in my later life. I have one week of therapy left until i am given the choice to end/contine/intensify therapy, and Ive lately been disheartened by how little they have helped. Something I never discussed with my therapist was that I believe I was sexually assaulted at age 6 by my cousin (11F) back in my home country. As far as I know, no one knows beside me and her, and she seperated from the family a while back as her mother divorced. If they did know, they may have chosen to never tell me in the hope I was too young to remember the event. The memory is so hazy that at times I question if it ever occured. Even then, I like to think of it of had having no effect on my life, but recently the memory has been surfacing more. Ive never looked back on this memory and thought of it as trauma, I have no feelings for the memory at all. But can something that I regarded as so insignificant result in symptoms many years later, or am I merely grasping at any clue to the cause for my depression. I feel sick when thinking of bringing it up to my therapist, Ive never told anyone but a very close friend of it. How vital would this piece of info be to my therapist?",depression

20006,"Never in a million years did I think I’d be on Reddit writing something like this but maybe this is my soul trying to find some sort of salvation from the pain. I’ve been thrown into the proverbial fire as of late &amp; I feel like I’m just unable to get a grip on anything. 

1. My father passed away &amp; I hadn’t spoken to him in well over 10yrs prior to his passing. He was extremely abusive to me as a child to the point or making me bleed. I am not really sad about his passing but feel many of the “what if” things in relation to a better childhood.

2. I found out that my sister is not 100% my sister &amp; we don’t have the same father &amp; we both have been lied to about that our entire lives by our mother who I also don’t have the best relationship with. We did DNA tests two days ago for absolute concrete evidence of everything so now it’s a waiting game. I live in the same house as her &amp; have been dying to get out on my own but financially am unable to at the moment due to my own disability cystic fibrosis.

3. The girl I have been in a situation-ship doesn’t feel the same way I do about her. This one hurts me so much, honestly more in a sense than my dad passing. I feel like I’m mourning the loss of someone still alive but we are still friends &amp; love one another. I never thought I’d catch feelings for her but here we are. We have a beautiful friendship , the sex is great &amp; we have so many great laughs &amp; moments. She’s been such a bright spot in my dark times lately. I wanted to see if we could give things a real try but she just doesn’t feel how I do. This now is breaking my heart &amp; don’t know how to navigate it. I don’t want to just get rid of her as a friend, I genuinely care about her. She is fine with continuing what we are doing but I’m not sure I can do that right now with how I feel about her. 

Everything is just compounding ontop of eachother &amp; I feel like I’m suffocating. My appetite is shot, I feel restless where I feel like I’m going crazy &amp; I’ve been having very dark thoughts &amp; find humor in self harm jokes to myself &amp; my close friends. 

Maybe this is a cry for help, maybe I’m trying. I’m not sure. But if anyone reads this &amp; has advice or a heart to be here for me I would love &amp; cherish your kindness. Thank you .",depression

20799,"I am 20 years old, and a university student in South Korea.

When I was in high school, I was betrayed by friends who I really trusted. I experienced that one of my closest friends got bullied and quit school. I was so afraid, and I tried to befriend students in other classrooms. Therefore, they were my best friends. 

During the field trip, they said that they disliked me and asked me to leave. I was so shocked. I tried to talk with the teacher, but it was meaningless. After that, I was alone, and I spent days in fear. A week later, I was diagnosed with severe depression. I really had tough times. As I tried to commit suicide, I was hospitalized for 2 months.

I believed that the only way to change this situation is going to university. I studied hard and others said my achievement is a miracle.  However, my time stopped in high school. My heart and the way how to treat others are the same as a high school student like the days, I spent the whole night crying. I am good at making good relationships with professors. I treat them politely and as people who I have to learn. Meanwhile, I am not good with friends, because I am so afraid and don't know how to make a good relationship. 

Have you seen 'The Glory'? They said victims were abandoned at times they suffered. I totally understand what they meant. 

Fortunately, my medication is almost over. The psychiatrist will not prescribe antidepressants soon. That's what I dreamed and wished for. However, I am so afraid, because “I am cured” doesn't mean “my past is recovered”.

20361,"I so depressed and I feel like I can’t tell anyone because I don’t want it getting back to my ex. He broke up with me a little bit ago because he’s dealing with his own mental health stuff. He didn’t want to hurt me in the process or hurt our relationship and pushed me away. I didn’t see it coming. He was happy with me and us but not himself. I thought he’d let me be there for him. I don’t want him to find out I’m struggling too and worry I just want him to get better. But I miss him so much and miss talking and seeing him everyday. He’s my best friend and I wish we could just be there for each other right now. 
Ever since the break up I’ve just had more added to my plate. My grandma is sick, my friends who should be there for me right now aren’t, and my work is having more layoffs in an already terrible job market. 
I struggle to find joy in anything right now. I wake up everyday just so sad and I cry daily. I sleep too much and yet I have nightmares and trouble staying asleep. I barley have an appetite I’ve lost over ten pounds in a month. 
I know he cares and hopes this isn’t the end for us too but all the uncertainty in my life is so hard to deal with. 
I’m just so stressed and sad. It’s so hard to grasp my current reality. I miss him so much. I’m trying to take care of myself but everything is hard right now.",depression

20556,"on a work trip. got paid to sit in my hotel room all day. at night these thoughts overwhelm me. a few years ago i met somebody who changed the trajectory of my life. 

he was so beautiful. he had such a beautiful soul. he was so unlike me. i was obsessed with him. we even dated for a while. i made his life a living hell. i never treated anyone in my life as poorly and callously as i treated him. im sure if he stayed with he would've died. honestly he probably would've killed himself. he ghosted me. not a day goes by i dont think of him. i wish i could go back and fix things. and never say a word to him. i miss his face. i miss his voice. i miss his hair so much. im sure those are all long gone. as he transitioned more and more of what i fell in love with would fade away. i can't even imagine what he looks like now.

its sad. the thing i miss most about him. is the way he tasted. what kind of human answer is that. im a monster. a devil. i would kiss him for hours. until his lips were bruised. i would take the anger i have for this life out on him. i could still hear him gasping for air. i look at my hands and wonder why. 

i've been depressed my entire life. it was cruel of me to spread it to him. he was an angel. and i set him on fire to keep me warm. im a walking black hole who tried to destroy him. but he survived. he has a pretty good life now it looks like, well, from the outside anyway. but my soul won't heal. and i can't forgive myself. and he never will. he never should. 

i can't care about anything anymore. my parents loved me so much. my friends and family too. but i can't feel it. i don't deserve it anyways. there's no reason why or how someone like me could be so evil. i feel like a murderer. this isn't depression. these are just consequences. you wouldn't say a murderer serving his sentence in prison, in solitary confinement, has depression. he's inhuman. he can't feel a thing.",depression

I have everything I wanted, friends, family,  a truck, but i just feel empty. I can’t explain it, I just don’t know. Im 16 and yes some people will tell me to be great full for what I have, which I am but it doesn’t mean Im not happy, am I selfish? I don’t do drugs, but some times the thought comes to my mind and I wonder would everything be better? I have also wondered what would happen if i just disappear, i know I would be missed by my friends , family, siblings, but I don’t think I would care, it’s selfish i know. But I’m being honest, life is on repeat of you know what I mean. I wake up, go to school, get home, eat, go to sleep and do it all over it again. It’s fucking tiring. I have thought of suicide but it’s a dumb way to go out, tbh I’m only here cus I’m scared too die, and my mom needs me. Like I’m great full yes, but I just don’t wanna be here you know. I would never do something that would hurt my mom. Please can someone just put sense into me, or just give me advice anything.",depression

20086,"I was already having a pretty bad day today, feeling depressed, and feeling abandoned by people I care about. I figured I'd at least find some comfort in food, so I headed to my colleges dining hall buffet and grabbed a box to put some food in for takeout. Well I spotted one of the foods I really like, hashbrown casserole but that's not really important, and started grabbing myself a decent portion. But with how layered thin it was, to get a reasonable portion, it would take more scoops because of the thinness. Well I guess one of the workers spotted how much was gone from me scooping n they made jokes with one saying ""gah damn"" when looking over at me and his work buddies laughed. One of the others said ""don't worry about it, we're glad u enjoy it"" and I usually don't care about jokes like that, but after the day I had, that was the final straw. I finished grabbing my food, went to my room n broke down. First time I had cried in months because I was getting better at managing, but once everything starts piling up, you never know what can be the gum wrapper that topples the pile.",depression

20577,"Because I am trying to not think about all the negative things that I am going through and as soon as someone asks me this question, it reminds me that things are not okay and I get sad.

Not only that, but 9/10 times, people ask this question because it became a habit and not because they ACTUALLY care how you are. It has become just an addition or an alternative to ""hello"". I only ask people how they are if they seem to not be in a good mood and I would actually care to find out what's wrong. Someone might say ""what if they may not seem sad but still have something wrong with them?"" Then that most likely means that they are hiding it and that they would rather not talk about it (like many of us).

I always say that I am fine just because I don't want to explain to them my issues because they would not understand at all and I know this because I have tried this MANY times.

I believe many people here also feel the same or at least something similar to this.",depression

20228,"My spouse cheated on me a long time ago, after which things became pretty good. She was nice to me, worked her way to get me back, and make me love her. Which I did for about 3-4 years and then I started feeling the urge to have someone else in my life and see what it feels like to be with someone else than my wife. I went down the worse path, I lied to someone about my marriage being in turmoil and how I still feel neglected by my spouse. I started giving more time to the affair over calls and WhatsApp, instead of providing the necessary time to my wife and daughter.

Recently everyone found out about this, as the woman I was involved with was talking to me while her husband was home. Now her husband informed everything to my wife. I am constantly trying to say sorry and ask for forgiveness. My wife is talking to the other women and she is providing more details about what I used to say and not. 

During this affair sometimes I will feel weird about patching up with my wife but will stop myself and withdraw myself because I used to feel it was unjust to her while I am in another relationship. To touch her kiss her or even say I loved her. I am this horrible human being and I feel I don't deserve any of them. 

Now I have a hard time just living let alone working. I wish my wife forgives me. I tried talking her into marriage counseling but her point is you have mental issues, why should she suffer?

Cant look into my daughter's eyes (she doesn't know anything). Same with Mom. My only support system in the world after I lost my dad this year was my brother. He knows everything about this now and is withdrawn from me, and anyway, he lives in a different country. 

I will be ok living alone too, I mean I will understand if my wife leaves me now. She has not decided anything yet. But to stay like this, it's difficult, do I have a right to live? Is there any hope for a monster like me? Please help if you think I am still worth living and loving.",depression

I have been the JV coach before, but I am filling in for our head coach who is out for the season on personal leave, there are a bunch of mitigating factors that should make me comfortable, including the fact that I know many of the players already, expectations for the team are low given our traditional performances, it’s a great group of seniors. 

Despite this, I am extremely nervous to the point where it is impacting my sleep and it’s all I think about during the day. I feel like a complete imposter, because I don’t really know the game of lacrosse to nearly the same level as the previous coach.

20014,"As the title states I cannot handle living or my mental state any longer. I am 22 and since I was a kid I have been bullied a lot throughout the years. The past few 4-5 years I have not experienced bullying but extreme loneliness. I have tried everything to make friends and get a life but everything is unsuccessful. I was never able to talk to girls either but somehow 3 years ago I met one and we fell in love but we broke up recently and a lot due to me not having a life and being able to make friends but during this time she was the only thing motivating me to keep going. We promised each other to always remain friends and we did for a while but 1 month ago she cut of all contact with me after some fights and disagreements. I have tried getting her back as a friend by she just ignores a my texts. I was already severely depressed the past few months about my loneliness and this just made it even worse. I hate when people say it always becomes better, even though I want to believe it and I did for a while I can’t anymore because it has been disproven my entire life. I don’t see a future where anything will become better and I don’t see any solutions any longer, everything feels hopeless and I view myself as useless and pathetic. I get panic attacks constantly during the day and I can’t take it anymore. I just want to disappear and not have to feel this any longer. I know that no one would notice if I disappeared and it would not impact anyone’s life that much. I can’t stand feeling like this anymore. I hate my life.",depression

20446,"Hi everyone, first time posting. I apologize in advance for any error in my writing, English is not my first language.
I'm 30 and I've struggled with my emotions since I can remember. I am often sad about my life, I think I suck at most things even when I do succeed, I've been planning to kms since I was very little.
I find it difficult to talk about what troubles me because I feel like nobody believes me, that it doesn't matter, nobody can do anything about it so why bother.
When I decided to talk to a psychiatrist in August I was diagnosed with depression, but I still struggle to think that others will accept this. My parents want to find a solution like I'm a leaking roof or something like that, it's disheartening.
I don't know what I wanted to say but I wanted to talk to someone who's not my everyday. I hope my post didn't break any rules, I read them and I think it didn't.",depression

20335,"I’m just living. I’m not constantly stressed or anxious anymore, but I still consider suicide a lot, and I don’t know why. I do get anxious and stressed every now and then, and when I do it is pretty bad. 

I just got over a couple years of seriously shitty feeling depression that I didn’t talk to anyone about really. Therapist didn’t help, I was stressing my parents out too much, friends don’t like talking about serious topics. So I just rode it out on my own and convinced myself that those feelings don’t matter. 

Now I just feel like nothing matters. I still find joy and have good days and bad like everyone else, but I resort to wanting to kill myself whenever anything goes too wrong or I get too worried. 

I feel pretty casual about it too, like I don’t give a shit if I die at this point. I’ve lost a lot of faith in god and grown distant from my family. I tell people I’m working on myself but quite frankly I don’t know what the hell I’m trying to do in life. I guess just get to a point where I don’t have it anymore.

The other day I was driving home after a stressful conversation with my dad, and I just kept driving past my house. I went to this road I go on every now and then to drive fast (lots of hills and not any people cause it’s a rural backroad). Also I want to clarify I can see all of the road for a mile, I wouldn’t do something if it put others in danger. Anyways back to complaining about myself. 

I was driving my usual path, and I was actually considering swerving into a tree. I was honestly losing my shit, crying hard for the first time in a while over lots of thoughts, while also happy doing what I love. I only stayed on the road because of my parents and knowing how hard their lives with depression have been. I can’t purposefully crash my car and have them live with that.

But the way things are going I don’t know. I’m just driving towards my death. I’m just living.",depression

Nobody has time for me. Nobody gives a damn what I want. But everyone needs me to exist.

Is it worth living when you have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to?

I'm just existing for the sake of existing. I'd rather not exist anymore. My feelings are not severely painful by any measure, but they are constant and gnawing.

I never found a purpose in life, nothing that makes me truly happy, all I really do is sit all day and play videogames, pump my body with caffeine and sugar and hope for brighter days to come, even though I know they wont or that theres a small likelyhood of it happening.  
Every day I consider more vile ways to commit suicide, which is something I havent considered at all just a year prior. My mother calls my reasons for lack of happiness stupid and I havent been offered any comforting words, like ever.

And I’m trying so hard to see the brighter side. I’m trying so hard to be positive. I’m trying so hard to find the balance but it’s not working. It’s times like this when I’m sitting in silence where there are no sounds and I don’t have my headphones to drown out all these negative thoughts. I have to sit with them in silence suffering.

I want friends and I want to build meaningful relationships with people but people are just so tiring I hated having friends but brushed it off as maybe I wasn’t friends with the right people. They were so overwhelming I just wanted to be quiet all the time. 

I don’t know. I don’t know whether I want to die or if I want to live. If I live my life it won’t be mine, and if I die supposedly my life won’t be mine either according to some book of stories.",depression

20113,"I talk a lot, I get it from people not wanting to talk to me as a child or telling me I talk to much when I share something I enjoyed. Which created childhood depression and it effected me in several ways and still does 14+ years later (I’m 19 to put that into perspective to just how long I’ve had dealt with this). One of my earliest memories is wanting to become a smart muggle witch like Hermione from Harry Potter. I was so exited about the films I would talk to almost everyone I came across about HP, well almost everyone told me I can’t/I will never be able too/that’s bad/ect but more than anything they would tell me I talk to much, it isn’t ladylike to speak that much. I was 5 years old. As the years went by I was told not to speak often, and anytime I spoke about anything I knew something of such as history or science and especially if I was excited about it I would be cut off and told I spoke to much. All of my “friends” growing up would ignore me in groups or not pay attention if I wanted to join the conversation. Bc of that I became a wall flower and I over tall when people talk to me. I get very depressed most days due to my excessive talking. I know my excessive talking is coming from anxiety, but the depression of feeling alone hurts more.

20783,"
Fear and anxiety rule his every thought , loneliness and despair fill every breath in his lungs. 

Darkness reigns unchallenged, the light is all gone. Feelings of happiness extinguished and drowned, deluge of pain and suffering watered them down. 

Like an ancient warrior facing certain death, wounded , bruised and bleeding he marches on. 

Flashes of memories that are long gone, hints of an era that once had begun. With fire and passion his heart once fought. Stabbed and damaged it won’t pump blood , only anger rage flow thru the holes. 

For his Queen he swore once that death he would take. Just to protect her from the evils out there. But no one had warned him of the evil within. A festering wound that ends in gangrene . Rotting soul and heart but not too fast. Ensuring he suffers as much as he can.

The dream of a life was just a mirage . Leading the warrior into an inescapable trap. Battle after battle, war after war. Trenches of anguish is where he stands. 

What was the purpose the man thought to himself. Looking around for someone to help. No one in sight to hear his plight, only more darkness and none of the light. 

Hopeless and tired he kneels on his sword. With honor and valor he lets it all go. Plunging the steel makes the flesh cold. Followed by warmth of the pouring hot blood.  

Seconds feel like years as life flashes by. He enjoys every memory with his last ever smile. 

But out of the darkness someone reached out . Returning the light and the life that ran out. 

The warrior perplexed looked almost scared , for he had never encountered no one that cared. 

His story unfinished and with no clear path. But now he’s determined to let go of the past. 

Wounds that are healing wounds that will come. Master the pain that will never be gone.

No matter how close or how far. He will continue to battle this war.",depression

20461,"Food does not taste good. The sunshine doesn't warm my skin as it used to. Exercise leaves me only drained not satisfied. I cannot live properly, but I cannot die. I have a loving family and I cannot do that to them. I am hanging in a superposition. A hell of routine that is not longer designed for me but for who I used to be. My study turned my passion into mindless work. I am too broke and too far down the study to stop it now. I have one year left. Therapy does not help and I do not trust depression meds. I am lonely surrounded by people. What does one do when negativity takes over? I was told depression means I am not in the right place. That my lifestyle needs to change. Yet...I am barely managing to do the little I am doing. I am trying to take responsibility for my situation and change what I can control but...it all falls short. I feel like I am chasing something but even when I stop and appreciate the moments it is just a fleeting break from the endless torture.

It feels that the world is going mad, each year they discover something else that we humans broke. From microplastics, carbon emissions to the impending doom of nuclear war. I would say that I am losing hope but I am already hopeless.

Yet...this is not how I felt just a few days ago. It comes and goes. For a few days I feel like a human and then I plunge back into this torture. Like on a rollercoaster. I am pushing away the little friends that I have, because if I stay silent then they still feel somethings up and when I open up they just don't like the negativity. I don't even know why I am writing this post. Just to kill time before it finally kills me.",depression

This life is the same fking thing, its just an experience, its nothing special, its not what all these people are making of it. Literally this life is utterly miserable objectively for the majority of people, and i dont care if some minority gets to enjoy this life and squeeze max pleasure from it. If i dont want to be here than its fking obvious that im not obligated by anything to continue to stay here. And its not only about me not wanting to continue, its about this life being such a fking terrible painful shit that its unbearable to even exist there. Something or Someone clearly designed this life this certain way so that we cant leave this life any moment without pain without fear without any aftermath whatsoever. They even called it ""death"" and gave us this stereotype that death is so dramatic, its so scary, its so bad, you should survive and avoid it. Like its 100% objective truth that if everyone had an ability to simply end this life whenever they want, nobody would be depressed, there would be no suffering, no misery, we wouldn't even have this conversation. I mean imagine even having to fking talk about this miserable shit i mean existence should be about having fun, to be happy, to have beautiful memories, not to be stuck in this shit and wondering what the actual fk is this. There is not one asshole that will tell me that i should live this life if i dont want. I would beat the shit out of any bitch that would hesitate to even suggest to me that i should do something that i dont fking want.

20284,"You can’t help me. You can, but you can’t. You could care, so you can help me. But you won’t, so you can’t. 

I see that now. I was hoping someone would not come and fix everything for me but that they would care. I tried it all, I tried caring so that maybe someone would too. I tried not to expect anything back and I did that but when things got rough and I cried for help, no one was there. People would only take from me, and now that I’m kind of empty, with nothing left to give, no one’s there.

But only kind of. It’s not so bad that I can’t see a light at the end or that I’ll never smile again. It’s that I’ll probably never get the only thing I ever craved for. That’s terrible actually but I don’t know, shit has a way of always getting worse than it is.

While that undoubtedly sucks, life is about more than that for me. I’m not down 24/7, thank the Lord, so I can’t act like my life is over. Get me not wrong, sometimes it stings really awfully and for long periods too. But there’s an entire world out there beyond my own personal lil one that is fascinating, to use one word to describe life.

I should go back in my head. It was always great every time, I would be my own patter in the back and it worked, it works, because I never let myself down in the sense that I always care.

And it’s not like I want to be babied around either. May not seem like it but I’m a strong person inside, I don’t go down easy and every time I do I never stay there longer than necessary. But even the strongest need a helping hand every now and then and I’ve never had that, not genuinely.

Now is one of those times. And what I needed now isn’t even that big a deal. Just someone who would listen and understand. You’d think that wouldn’t be so hard to find.

Anyway. C’est la vie, cheries. I want to go back and fix myself by myself like I’ve always done but not come back this time. It was only when I came back and hoped that I got bit in the ass. Every single time. But no longer.

I’m smart enough to understand and to move on and to focus elsewhere and to do so many other things this world has to offer that fulfill me. One of the best lessons I learned in life was how to take the L. Accept it, let it go and carry on.

Here’s to hoping",depression

20506,"I am the happy-go-lucky type of person, I have a good life, with a fantastic wife, a very nice house, a lovely dog and a great car. I have no financial issues either, actually you could say that I'm pretty rich in life - financial but mostly generally 'in life'.  Also I am reasonably healthy - I need to work out for some stamina but I hardly have any overweight, don't smoke, don't drink, I eat healthy. Sounds great, right? 

I was burnt out in 2021 because I worked 24/7 for many years - and even though it feels like the burnout is mostly gone, I can't really get myself to do anything.. and it's starting to get to me - I am feeling frustrated about it more and more.

Honestly don't feel like I am depressed. I feel happy and mostly relaxed w/o anxiety. I am absolutely motivated to do a lot of things - both in the work and private spectrum.. maybe I even want to do too much stuff. I REALLY want to do all the things in my head and achieve new goals. But I sit on the couch and then when I want to start with something I just can't get myself to do it. And when I do, I don't finish it.

Examples are typically:

* I have some great online business ideas and I can start them all myself from my home office. I start the projects but I never finish.
* I have a great gym at home and I want to work out at least a few times a week, but I just don't do it.

Daily tasks are not an issue and I do them with pleasure - e.g. cooking, cleaning, administrative tasks, garden work, etc. It's not a problem at all. I am guessing because they are small isolated tasks that I can finish and then move on.

Anyway, I had intakes with a couple of therapists and they all say that they think I seem very good and not depressed, that I should do more fitness and are not sure they can help me any further. And even though they're right - I should get more fit - but I really doubt that's what is keeping me from actually doing/finishing things.

Maybe it's just the last burn-out issues I am experiencing or is something else? Depression anyway? Or something related? Thoughts?",depression

Last year had been so weird. I graduated. Fucked a relationship up. Didn't cheat but the ex couldn't take that I slept with someone else. He was broken so I spiraled guilty anxious lonely. Also I was preparing for a big test I cared a lot. I used to be worried, cried all day. Then snap. I feel nothing. I'm sleeping all day when I go towards the books I'm like why. I'm so numb. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with atypical depression and gave me pills which I'm not allowed to take coz mom says there will be side effects. 
Today I was allowed to ride a bike. I hit a car and fell down. It was a minor accident but bro. I realized I felt nothing after that. Nothing at all. This couldn't have been me. I was a girl who was afraid to ride  bikes I used to freak out so much now I just don't care. Not even the fact that I'm able to ride the bike. If it was the earlier me I'd feel goosebumps with a sense of achievement, I'd feel fear anxious and scared about the accident.

20672,"when i was 14 going on 15 i was going to end it before my 15th birthday. ihad it all planned out and without triggering anyone/giving any ideas, i knew it was going to work and be successful. i remember going to where i was about to do it, i felt such a rush , so much excitement and relief knowing that it will all be over in a few months. i decided that i was going to do it either 1-2 months before my birthday so it gives my family enough time to recover and quickly get over it, then my birthday won’t be difficult as it will be a while since i’ve passed. 

a boy in my class also told me that when i die, he will throw a huge party and invite the entire year group. this made me more excited to end it, gave me that motivation knowing that no one would care and instead see it as such an amazing thing that i’m not here. for once in my life i’m doing the right thing. i wanted to know more about it and would always bring it up to him in the class, asking who’s going to be invited, can anyone bring a plus 1 and where it would be. 

suddenly though life just happened, my mom was in an abusive relationship, she couldn’t take it anymore and so we had to move away to start a new life, new school, everything. i didn’t realise any of this was happening until we actually left. in that moment i just wanted to be there for my mom, she would be crying a lot and looked so drained. in a new environment having to start all over again, my original plan of ending it back home i just knew in my heart it wouldn’t work and my mom really needed me so i stayed alive

i’m 19 now and its gotten better for everyone but me. i still have these thoughts and i regret not doing it, even after everything that happened which i know just makes me a bad person ): i’m in therapy rn but it’s early days i idk if i should tell her all this. oh well.

20614,"So I enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as I continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. Before this recent journaling expedition I had NEVER journaled.  Maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose.  I was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc..  however, I couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever.  It just felt awkward and silly.  I debated on doing it for a while and I think one day I said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all I write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit.  So my first entries were very crude.  I'm looking at one now and it basically says : 

THC NJ is COOL
APPLY TO JOBS
START NEW RPG
GONNA COOK STEAK
START READING DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? (finished it that week)
THIS IS MY 1ST TIME JOURNALING
MAY ADD MORE LATER, lol
TALKED TO LILY BILLY, need to more often

Then l stated a short gratitude for the day.  This first journal entry I was grateful for reddit, cause I believe I made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal.  I posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so.  My first entry was on 2-12-23. So I've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks I'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but I don't like doing that cause now I notice a sort of disconnect from myself when I don't journal habitually.  It's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress.  Thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it.  

I skip a week or so into my journaling and now I'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes.  Like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it.  I thought I would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what I use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits.   I just moderate it by USUALLY including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. But not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself.  You don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude.  If you don't feel it don't write it.  So yeah fast forward in my journal and I'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that  some goals and gratitudes.  Short term goals.  I begin to write about accomplishments I've made and things I see different in myself.  I talk about some of my inner growth but I'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half I've been fucked up like 20 of those days.  Or how I feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause I can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times.  Dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated.  I'll write how I finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment.  A big accomplishment I had to write down was hygiene.  When I was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression I'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering.  So I wrote down that accomplishment.  It effects self esteem, ego and confidence.  When you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better.  You have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, I can't believe I actually accomplished that, or shit I can't believe I even WANTED. To accomplish that.  Being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling.   Theres no real WAY to journal and I'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day (good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak) sometimes it's topics I wanna go down rabbit holes on YouTube and I'll mention it in the journal so that if I forget I'll  come back to that page on my own at some point and remember.  I could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now.  Must be pretty fucking cool.  Get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started.  Reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of GOOD information and I took what I thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as I wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but I've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as I continue doing it.  All in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself.  I know my explanation wasn't the best, so I recommend also searching reddit or Google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs.

do you have any tips how to deal with rumination? I know that trying to suppress it is counterproductive.

20835,"Greetings, I am new to this sub and relatively new to Reddit. Let me give you some background on why I’m posting here. I ran across a post about a month ago from a young teenager about being depressed and all that (you know, the typical teenage woes). Out of kindness, I replied with some words of comfort, and after a while we started messaging and have kept in touch since. I am by no means an expert (outside of my personal experience dealing with depression and anxiety most of my adult life), but all signs point to him having some sort of mental health issues.

Like everyone, he has had good days and bad days, but lately things have taken a darker turn and I’m realizing I’m in over my head. For a while our conversations never involved suicide, and I know I’m not really equipped to help people struggling with those thoughts, but now it’s come up a few times and I’m starting to feel like I could be in danger of inadvertently saying the wrong thing or somehow making the situation worse. My first inclination was to steer him in the direction of talking to parents or another trusted adult, getting therapy, etc., but for several reasons that’s not an option right now.

At this point, I’m completely committed to helping this kid get the help he needs and I won’t abandon him just because this situation has become more complicated than I originally anticipated. I started myself down this road, and I won’t give up until I know he’s safe or at least in the right hands. I don’t want to get into any details in this post, but I could really use some advice from anyone who understands how to talk to a very depressed / suicidal kid who probably has mental health issues and is desperately searching for a reason to keep living.",depression

I've been home since February and I feel things going dark again. I'm sleeping way too much. Have no energy or desire to do anything and the awful thoughts of mot living are coming back. 
I'm in between places right now. Kicking off a new career, that's why I came home. But things are going slow and I cant move away right now.

When I wake up, I turn on my computer and- if I'm not doing something with my family, I'll sit for 12-14+ hours a day- with breaks of making food and stuff...  
Everything has become obscurely pointless, I feel like I'm wasting my life on ""temporary"" things... A  part of me, just wants to stay in the dark and discover the vast illusion of suffering- while the other part, wants to start and become something grand.  


I despise how society is built, everything feels so complex and demanding. Many times again, I've wished that the world was of a past era- a downgrade, if you will- where economy, complexity, orderliness, greed and money wasn't discovered.

20891,"Tw: (thoughts of) self harm, drug abuse, suicidal thoughts 
(m/22, if you care)


First things first, I really need to vent right now and dont know if anyone is even gonna read that but I just need to get this out of my head.
And sorry, if my english isn't good...

So, I've been battling depression for over a decade, I've mostly gotten better after years of therapy and carefully choosing the people around me so I've been pretty stable for a few years with less and less backlashes.

Today marks the first day after about 3 years where I'm getting extremely intense thoughts about self harming, drug abuse and even suicidal thoughts.

I've already been in a pretty bad mood today, overthinking a lot and shit like that and I had to go to social event I didn't really wanna take part in but usually it turns out better than expected. It wasn't like that today. I've felt even worse and useless (despite my friends trying to cheer me up) and realized that I'm not good at anything. I tried to drink those thoughts away with some cocktails (which usually works wonders for me in social events) but that just made it worse.
Since I got home I've just been sitting on my bed and staring at the wall, my thoughts going through a downward spiral. I drank some more and feel better and worse at the same time. I've even got to the point that I noticed another issue I haven't even realized before but makes so much sense comparing it to the events in my life. Then I thought of numbing my pain with a method I used years ago, forced myself not to because the scars have almost faded out. Then I thought about what drugs I could use to distract my mind, even started to research before I stopped myself and decided to rant here.
I'm very aware of my thoughts which makes me instantly feel regretful and even more like a shitty person.

I just want to cry and try to vent through that but that's something I still can't do. Love society for teaching boys that they aren't allowed to cry.

Anyways, I hope I can force myself to focus on something else now that I've written this shit down. My mind does feel a bit clearer now without taking some extreme steps.

Also to everyone reading this: I hope you have a great day tomorrow. And maybe we can all fight our inner demons some day and live a better life. Just trying to survive one day at a time.",depression

20950,"All I want is a hug, a real tight one where I can't get out off easily I want to be squeezed, my face reclined on their shoulders, ears rubbed against theirs. I yearn for a human's warmth.

I got no one in my life right now that I can truly be open with.  Stuck in an environment where I feel caged, suffocating, in desperation to grasp anyone for hugs.

I want to lie down in someone's bed, converse with and sleep in their care. I want to feel safe, loved, and shamelessly desired.

I've been depressed for so long, it has become a part of my life. At one point I'm smiling, then enraged, followed by desolation and despair. I'm sad, broken, alone.

All I want is a hug, a human touch. That is all.

Making art gives me comfort, even if it is for a fleeting moment. But besides that, I'm broken, too shattered to be pieced together.

I don't want pity nor fake niceness. Just a genuine hug, a big bear hug.",depression

20139," (not saying people here are fake but I’ve become more of a hermit). Want to move back home and pursue schooling/certification (medical billing and coding). Feeling insanely depressed here.

So I made the move out here last year 2 months before turning 29. 

At first I enjoyed it. I’m able to buy weed whenever I want, I get a better pay than I did back home, and I don’t feel like a child living at home. And the weather was pretty nice.

But over time, it started wearing on me. I miss my nieces and every time we’ve factimed they look so much older. I feel sad that I’m not there. I miss my family and our family dog. Also I ran out of my ADHD/anxiety/depression medications and haven’t tried finding a new psychiatrist/therapist because I don’t want to deal with the hassle of searching around. 

I feel like I haven’t really connected to anyone here. I thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday, that someone would recognize me and I’d make friends (which is what happened back home), but it hasn’t happened. I have no dating life at all. I get 3 or 4 days off a week and spend them alone. Sometimes I’ll game with my high school friends online, which is the only thing I really look forward to, but this fucks my sleep schedule even more.

I work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore. I try sleeping during the day but it’s difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud. Why don’t they just wear headphones?

My sleep schedule is shit. I hate going to run errands because I have to walk 15 minutes to my car. 

I snowboard for like 2 hours and then feel like going home because I get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines.

Once the season ends, they’ll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights, but then I’ll have to get a roommate. Having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and I don’t like it. No privacy at all.

When I go back home, I want to start regularly going to therapy again, but am thinking “how can I do that if I don’t have a job”. How do I ensure I have a job when I get back home? I don’t live there right now so how the hell do I get interviews????",depression

20171,"Seriously, every single one of us are fucking warriors. 

From the monumental effort it takes to drag ourselves into consciousness when we just want to sleep forever to showing up at work &amp; pretending you haven’t spent the morning crying or thinking of hurting yourself or wanting to just check out permanently or all of the above.

I know it’s horrible that we do have to deal with it, but taking a second to recognize how monumentally tough we are is important I think as we always get stuck on the things we hate about ourselves.
It is one positive thing that every person reading this who is battling depression, the absolute Herculean strength we have is absolutely incredible.

If you’re reading this, you are incredible, the strength you show every single day is something that most people can’t even fathom.

But what I want to share when I think about killing myself, the first thing that comes to my mind is how it would inconvenience everyone around me. I don’t have much people who actually love me, like close to zero. But I still think about how it would be a hassle for them to like ship my body since I live far away from my immediate family.

The second thing that comes to my mind is its absolutism and irreversibility. I’m an atheist and I think when I’m gone, I have nowhere to go. I’ll just stop existing. No heaven to watch how they will react or if they will miss me or think of me at least.

20714,"what is your reaction when people vent or tell their pathetic and sad life to you ?

like for example : they live in the street or whatever and they ask you what u would do if that was you and you’re so weak that you’re already laughing at how QUICKLY you would’ve kys in this situation ?? 😂 like you don’t even do it on purpose but u laugh because your life is objectively so much less tragic but you’re kinda like « bro I could nevaaaaah 😭💅 »…

bc i feel like this 100% of the time, i can’t do the easiest thing ? like just go out and study for more than 2 months without encountering situations that just proves me i don’t belong in this society/world ? 

i’m so so so tired but there’s a fucking thing that just tolds me i don’t deserve to die but i mean that’s a lie, everyone deserves it, especially me…

idk what to do to not suffer and not kms ? i don’t like anything anymore , i’ve been thinking the same thing since i’m 15, i don’t have a passion, don’t have a purpose, and i’m fucking angry with everyone…

i’m actually really jealous of people getting out of depression… because that’s what shows they’re normal ppl that are getting sad when something v sad happens to them.

it’s not my case, i don’t like this world and i don’t wanna live in it.

idk it makes me sick to see ppl wake up everyday to do things i will never ever want to do in my life.???

like wtf you obtain by watching sunsets and walking and just wake up everyday ? it’s boring…. there’s no purpose wtf i’m so pissed rn….

sometimes i even picture myself in if i would have lived the same way as my parents and I KNOW I WOULD KILL MYSELF INSTANTLY. 

i don’t picture myself to be happy, ever.

i even have a boyfriend for 3 years now and i’m even more sad. 

the only thing that makes my life a little better is drugs music porn alcohol and sex (and since i have a boyfriend sex is so boring and even now that we are in a open relationship i don’t even have the motivation to see people) 

i used to live for flirting with guys before, i really had nothing else that made me feel good…

now idk… i just feel like a depressive person going through a depression ?sometimes i can’t even get out of bed to roll a joint bc i have no strength…

i dropped out of school a lot and i have nothing to offer to this word (officially, bc unofficially i know i’m smart, i know how to help people, i could have made myself useful but 1) ppl don’t let me show them, bc i have no diplomas or anything to show them my worth 2) even tho ppl want me somewhere i end up burn out int and disappearing bc deep down i don’t wanna live this life. PERIOD)

also i have a very strong sense of value and i find so fucking pathetic the fact that anyone can just THINK they’re smart and could be useful while being actually just a loser all their life. 

as an example my boyfriend which is even dumber than me is always thinking he can be rich and can enter any school (thanks to me he knows he  set his expectations too high) but he believes he can get rich af without KNOWING A SINGLE NOTION IN FINANCE OR BUSINESS COURSES ??? (he doesn’t even have a GED equivalent at 22 and their friends and even parents says « thinking is not his specialty »)

like wtf that’s why i’m also so mad at him, bc he’s disposed to be a loser but unlike me he’s happy like a fucking moron ??? 

idk that’s just too much, now he wants to go live abroad. AND GUESS WHAT.
that stupid moron never ever thought about that in his entire life so he doesn’t know any other cultures or languages except our (french) and he still thinks he can get a job in a country like Singapore Canada Switzerland The US ?????!!!!

anyway he’s a pure reflection of how much my life is a disaster. 

mentally he is the opposite of what i’ve ever wanted and supported ? 

even politically he’s just following the trends, he believes what anybody says as long as it’s in a video….

anyway i wanna die but i don’t even hate him enough to do that to him.

i feel pity for him but i’m the one who’s sad wtf",depression

That shit made me crazy; I hallucinated, attempted to crash my car, and almost ran away. Now, i’m on Lexapro on a high dosage and i just feel the same as I did without being on antidepressants. My dad originally told me that exercise would help but now im playing varsity softball and only feel good while im playing. when I stop my contention fades. I just feel like i’m moving throughout life with no purpose. My parents keep asking me about college. I got into four of the eleven colleges I applied to. I dont’ have good grades and dont have any motivation to fix it. I’m worried I wont be able to graduate and yet my parents still tell me “to be more productive” and “try harder.” I dont want to waste my parents money and fail out of university if I end up attending. I also feel kind of embarrassed, and I know I shouldn’t, to go to community college. People have told me that community college students are “weird” and “embarrassing.” I know thats not true and theres so many benefits of attending community college. I think i just need to stop listening to people but its easier said than done i guess.",depression

I hate people, this society is terrible. Betrayal runs rampant and hatred thrives. I feel unwelcomed as a white guy like the world is against me. I don’t feel unique at all, probably because no one tells me I am. In fact no one talks to me to begin with and if they do it’s because I talked first. 

I’m not sure I want to be here anymore simply because I’m not sure what I have to look forward too.

It’s selfish to say and I feel guilty but everything this life has given me has been taken away. Specifically human connection it is all I want. But I can not have it. My friends leave ignore and forget. My gf left and forgot. No one approaches I feel like a ghost.

These thoughts always go away once I’m in a better mood. Lastly, free time is never fun anymore. I’ll blank out and stuff or just not be able to relax.

The only time I can relax is with my school friends or with my online friend. Or in bed making up stories in my head. But my online one is only available like once a day for a few minutes.

20530,"I (24F) have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety over the past few years. The thing is I’m able to push through it all and put it on the back burner to interact in public settings. I’m funny, social and endearing with people who I’m not that intimately close with. Doing this I know it’s not how I genuinely feel but what people want me to be. I just can’t do it with people I love and are super close with. It feels fake and like I’m deceiving the people I love. 

That being said I met my bf and fell in love, the whole nine yards and we’ve been comfortably dating for over two years. I’ve grown to trust him and show him the parts of me that are slowly dying. Problem being I feel like the social persona I build is too fake for our relationship. 

I’m struggling to maintain my half of the relationship because of this. I’m so depressed/anxious all the time and I can’t bring myself to act and look happy. I’ve effectively gone hermit and can’t seem to navigate having a bf that I want around while I’m trying not to (ya know). 

I can fake it with everyone else I just don’t want to have that fake mess with him. I don’t know what do 

(Bf is aware of my mental health and is understanding but I think one can only be so understanding for so long.

 I really can't remember when I was ok, but at the same time it's been at least 2 years since I tried to kill myself, so I think there's an improvement. But now I just feel tired of trying, tired of existing, my hair is a mess, my bedroom is in a terrible condition and I have to force myself to eat. 

I can't find something that excites me, it's just like if I was alone all the time, but at the same time surrounded by people that can't comprehend this feeling.

Is it cause I don't have friends? My social anxiety got worse over time. As I met new people, they just treated me like a clown, it was as if I were their entertainment.

Even sending a message online makes my heart run like crazy. Once someone harassed me when entering a chat for kpop stans, it was a traumatic experience so I decided to go as incognito as I could.

And then I can't get treatment for this.

Why don't I go to a psychologist? You may ask, well... There's a member of my family that is a psychologist and she's really a manipulative and an hypocrite b**** so my parents don't let me see one. I know they are worried, but I need help.",depression

I’m struggling with depression and anxiety along with chronic back and neck pain. I’m currently on temporary disability for the past five months. I’ve been doing therapy with a therapist every week, plus physical therapy. I’m also on medication for depression/anxiety for over a year. My symptoms haven’t changed. I’ve shared my heart with friends. And recently a friend told me that I’ve been better in the past, and that friendship is a two way road. It can’t be one sided. This is true. I haven’t been to see her since she moved two hours away in November. We chat on video chat and text message several times a week. I am dealing with anxiety about traveling and going outside my house. I’m working on it with a therapist and it is slow going. 

I love my friend dearly and I asked that we take a break from talking because her seeing me this way is difficult to watch (friends words) and it’s not healthy for me to feel bad about myself after chatting with her.

i’m now surrounded by lovely people but they’re all leaving the city for summer break. i can’t stop worrying that i’ll become depressed again. my plan for now is to take summer courses and pick up a campus job (e.g. working at the library). perhaps i’ll pick up a casual part-time job as well. i just want to make sure that i keep myself busy. last summer was tough cause i didn’t have the means to meet people and interact, and i’m hoping this time it’ll be different if i put myself out there. honestly though, i just can’t help but worry a lot. depression is my worst enemy and it lives inside me. at this point, i can’t let it fucking win again.

I lost my dream job after 10 years there due to budget cuts. I know that I was one of the top performers there, but obviously that wasn’t visible to the person making that decision… Also this week my romantic partner whom I am completely in love with told me she isn’t interested in me anymore… I don’t understand why, but I’m also not surprised. I was reaching WAY above my station with her, so I always knew she would move on eventually, but it still broke my heart. I feel abandoned and alone…
Then on top of that, I constantly feel like a failure and a disappointment to the people who do love me. And like I’m a poison, slowly eating away at those around me and destroying my relationships. 
I hate myself so much… I remember when I used to be happy, when I used to be confident, but that seems impossible these days…",depression

20941,"Since I was young I saw how unhappy my parents were with their corporate jobs. From a young age I wanted to learn more about the world and see different cultures and experience different things and didn’t want to end up hating my career.

Ever since graduation all I’ve felt is failure towards my own life. I’ll see old classmates traveling, or starting a home business and living on a beach house in Hawaii and I’m honestly super happy for them. But at the same time it hurts.

I look to my life and see that I’ve fallen into exactly what I’ve feared most. I work a blue collar job in a factory, working long hours living paycheck to paycheck. I look back at the 16 year old kid I was and wish I could have slapped more sense into him to not worry so much about what family would think if I didn’t go the “traditional” route. If I’d just taken the steps I wanted to be who I wanted to be and not so frightened of them.

But now I’m sitting at work at 10pm getting ready for a 12 hour shift regretting how stupid I was as a kid for letting myself be pushed away from trying something new to fall into the 9-5 (or 11-11 in my case) rhythm that my family hated so much but pushed so hard for.

20213,"I (24) m for the past 10 years have been pretty depressed since I grew up moving home to home among my relatives constantly being around drugs and alcohol. Since I move around a lot I can't get a real attachment to anyone which is sad for me with the exception is my GF of 7 soon to be 8 years. But I lately I've begun to realize that I feel more comfortable being a depressed guy than happy, it's more like I rather be sad and tired so others can be happy. For example my gf's family have taken me in as their own even giving me the nickname ""Mikwap"" (mee-gwap) which roughly translated to home in our language. 

Anyways, I wouldn't say no to them when they asked something of me. Nothing too crazy, simple things like small chores that theirs children refuse to do, lend them money when they need, or drive 4+ hours for an event. There are more things. But I do stuff like this for my actual family too and it's making me feel drained mentally and physically which leeds to my depression. I don't have a lot of time to myself and I struggled with nearly becoming an alcoholic. I sacrifice myself like this because I want to see everyone smile and be comfortable especially the children in both families. I don't want them to have a hard life moving around or being around drugs and alcohol. Lately my gf has been telling me not to worry about everyone so much and take time to myself. I considered it but I'm worried something will happen if I'm not around to help. 

I'm at work right now while I type this. And would like some outside opinions. 

Also I'm sorry about the title, I just use small amounts of humors to hide my depression",depression

20582,"I've been seeing this person for about 5 months and until recently everything seemed to be going really well between us. We texted most days and hung out around 2 times a week on average which felt like a lot considering their time off and energy levels. About a month and a half ago they told me they were having a depressive episode. I've never had a partner with chronic depression and was pretty ignorant to what it can do so I was taken by surprise when they started ghosting me about a week ago. It was very abrupt and everything seemed to be going really well until then. Since then I've tried my best to learn up and it and it seems like this kind of thing is pretty common among people with chronic depression, especially those who've had a long history of partners who do not react well to their depression.  


Normally, I would not tolerate someone ghosting me, but reflecting back on everything they've told me about their depression and how they're dealing with it made me realize how much effort they put into trying to address their depression and maintain a relationship in spite of it. They've confided in me a lot of trauma they've had to deal with in their life and the type of thoughts they struggle with. Last time we hung out in person I could tell they'd been really struggling with some of those traumatic events recently. Even during this episode they had some pretty traumatic events happen back to back but still made an effort to hangout and talk to me with everything extra they were now having to deal with.  


I would like to make an effort to keep contact with them for a reasonable amount of time and hopefully get back to how we were before the depression got this bad. The ghosting still hurts, and it's totally possible that they are just being a bad person and not telling me they don't want to see me anymore, but after researching it and talking about it in therapy and with some of my friends who deal with depression I think it's more likely they're pulling away due to the depression.   


Over the past week I sent two messages trying to be supportive and let them know that I respect their space and want to interact with them in any small way they want. However, I've learned that these longer texts (more than a couple sentences) can be harder for a person going through a depressive episode to respond to and might make them feel worse for not responding. Definitely don't thing the messages were bad or anything and the people I shared them with agreed, but it looks like going forward I should keep messages shorter and easier to respond to with an emoji or maybe even a small response.  


Given all this, I'd just like some advice from those also struggling with chronic depression about how you'd like a partner who you've been seeing for as long as I've been seeing mine to communicate with you during situations like this. My current plan is to keep going with my life, but text them again a week from now and maybe continue doing that for 2-3 months or until they tell me to stop. I don't want them to feel overloaded with my messages and push them away but I do want to keep the idea in their head that I'm still here and want to be with them. Thank you all in advance!",depression

Also, I don't have any close friends like hers or I don't think I do. My ex called me a loner when we broke up and that's stuck with me.  
When this new girl talks of her successes I feel like shit again and get turned off. I want to be the Alpha, I want to be successful and take care of her. I get attracted to broken people , maybe because I'm broken. I don't know if it's fair to her if I continue this relationship. I want a relationship but it seems that I'm not ready. I want a bestfriend.

20313,"Everything in the world is grey and dull. My lows are low while I never have any highs in life, no matter what I try I genuinely can’t feel happy. I’ve gotten to the point where I just think I cant, I find myself questioning what I’ve done to deserve to feel this way. How I’ve slighted god in some way to put me through this daily mental torment. There’s so much anger, so much sadness and pain within me. All I want is a friend, maybe even someone to love. Since elementary school I’ve been heavily bullied, that accompanied with my anti social nature and depression and I ended up being an outcast all throughout school. I thought things would get better when I graduated, I thought I’d be entering a new bigger world that would give me opportunities to meet new people and finally make memories I can look back on fondly. I wish I still had that ignorant bliss as it was the one of the few times I’ve felt hope. But I see now that I had only convinced myself that was the case, the world in reality is just a cold dark place that doesn’t care about you with no one who will care about you in it. I’ve made a deal with myself that if things don’t get better by the time I turn 21, then I don’t want to live anymore. As of today I’ve got 389 days left, I’m not going to change my mind on this.

20459,"I am a little sad that I have to post on this sub again. i suffered from depression since high school. When I was in college, I saw a therapist, which really helped. I thought my depression was finally gone for good. But 3 years later (graduating from a community college), my therapist (another one) just helped me realize I still have depression. For a long time, I have mistaken it for anxiety, but depression made more sense. I feel so sad right now, I am dealing with a lot. I know the core of my depression and am fighting it. 

Anyways, my graduation is next month in April, and I don't feeling like celebrating. I don't want to go. I think I am worthless and not worth celebrated for. I think I don't deserve love, I don't like it when my family celebrates me, I just don't feel like it, I don't deserve all that love and happiness. I am scared. it overwhelms me.

I am aware that I am talking to myself very negatively. With everything (job, relationships, school,...) that is happening right now, I can't put more eggs in my basket, I really don't wanna deal with my graduation now, I have too much going on already.

The hardest part for me right now is I don't have any reason to be unhappy, nothing I can really point to and say this is making me feel like crap, and that makes me like a bratty little B crying and complaining

There's nothing really to talk to others about because again, there's nothing that I'd even remotely describe as saddening or upsetting.

20627,"Let me start that I used to feel shame and embarrassment about my depression. I used to hate myself and feel like a freak, and that nobody else ever went through the feelings I did. I was terrified of people finding out I suffered from depression, like it would make them think less of me and that I should be avoided and pitied. 

At some point, I had a certain epiphany, if you will. I concluded that depression is a normal thing that affects everyone. I have a feeling anyone who says they never get depressed isn’t being honest, or just afraid of judgement. Everyone gets depressed, and it shouldn’t be anything to be ashamed about.

I’m aware that, although everyone experiences depression, it doesn’t affect everyone the same. Some people, such as myself, have closed themselves off to people and made themselves a victim of this idea that they should feel ashamed of their depression and hide it from everyone, lest they be judged and ridiculed for it. 

But not me, not anymore at least. I think depression should be normalized, or at the very least accepted. People shouldn’t be made to believe they’re broken and need to be fixed. Depression isn’t something that needs to be “fixed”, it’s something that needs to be understood. The truth is, my depression isn’t going to just go away. It’s a natural, human emotion. It’s a part of the human condition, and only someone completely devoid of emotion would never go through it. 

I get it, it sucks to go through it. I know all to well, and can’t tell you how many times I just wanted to die. But i don’t regret my depression, because I believe it gives my more humility. I believe that by being more open and accepting of my depression, I can open up to others going through those painful, difficult times. I can show them that even though depression may never go away for good, there are ways to manage it healthily and effectively. I think it just starts by learning to understand and accept depression as a normal, human emotion that everyone goes through. Don’t ever think you’re the only one or that you have it worse than everyone else. If I could do it, you should be able to, too.",depression

I can’t leave, I can’t disappoint him. Day after day I’m trying my hardest to just survive. I’m not living anymore. Each day is another battle where the goal is to make it to the end. I don’t “live” anymore. My girlfriend has been hiding shit from me and lying to me and I’m such a coward and so lonely I can’t leave her. I try my absolute hardest to take her out do nice things care for her and I get treated like shit in return. I dragged her from her lowest point of binge drinking and self harm into a confident, hardworking girl who had goals. 2 and a half years of putting her before me for her to hangout with guys behind my back. I have no friends. My “bestfriend” I would talk to for years before anyone liked him or talked to him when everyone just hated him. Then finally he gets some other friends and he talks shit behind my back and tries to convince my girl to break up with me. Multiple times and she just lets it go on. My life isn’t valuable to no one else so why should it be worth something to me. The only person keeping me in this world is my mother who is the only one to always care about me and protect me. she’s my guardian angel always looking after me. And I’ve tried to be the best kid I could for her. No drinking no smoking no drugs nothing like that to waste the hard work that she has put into me.

20388,"I'm a bit of an introvert but through the years I learned to appear social and outgoing with people. In most contexts it's positive and useful. But in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person. 

I sometimes make jokes about memes, funny videos, etc. It's a good way to engage with other people at work for example. Rest of the people do the same. It's not that I'm joking more than the rest of the people. 

I never make jokes about the others, I'm very respectful. I even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people. 

Yet there's always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me. For example, now people at work make fun about my poor diet. I never detailed anything about what I eat, or if I had time to cook. And some of those people bring canned food. Or about some of my habits. When stuff like this starts happening, I feel really hurt. It's like I thought for a long time I was sharing funny moments with workmates, and actually everybody was clowning me. 

There are some ridiculous things about me. My voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age (37) and that would be a main thing. I'm gay and that makes it even more obvious, but I don't talk about my sexuality since it's private. 

I wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually I'm being friendly like the others. 

However I no longer care. Once I get fed up with all this, I avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me. I would consider to say what I wrote here in a polite way, but it's impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person. 

 So I've decided to not eat again with this people, just go outside or stay on my own. Not the first time it happens to me, but the first where i can just avoid it easily. 

I don't know why I trust people again and again. I know people are not evil per se, but other people can really be hell for depressed persons like me.",depression

20220,"
ok, so Me(24M) have been with my gf(25F) for a little over three years. We have had a very very difficult relationship! Recently have found out that she has BPD! We have had problems with being “intimate” with each other for majority of the relationship! She had given birth to her kid just a few months before we got together, so I figured it was post partom. Granted I have been a bit understanding not the best but I’ve tried very hard. However, it will be 4 years soon since she’s had him so I’m not understanding as much now as to why it’s such an issue to want me! We will have literal fights about it cause I feel like I’m not loved or wanted! She always tells me it’s not me and it’s just her head, but as a person who has A LOT of mental disorders I just can’t seem to believe her! So now she gets diagnosed with BPD, and I’m wondering if this would have an effect on her sex drive also! I also have BPD but I still have a sex drive… It’s getting to the point that I want to leave the relationship, cause I’m not getting what I need! I have a  VERY high sex drive and she was told about this when we started dating! I love her with everything in me and would love to spend the rest of my life with her and our child. I just don’t know if I can continue to go on feeling like this every time I want to be touched…",depression

20945,"For a little context, I’ve been suffering from primary anxiety and secondary depression (as my former therapist would say). I’ve dealt with this, therapy and medications since the age of 14 (I am now 22). I am sick of it. 

I did the whole change in environment- moved 500 miles from home. While I was lucky enough to do so, a short year went by and with many significant losses, I’m back to square one. I don’t want to return to the medications or the headache of retrieving my backstory to yet another therapist. I feel defeated, I’ve worked on myself so hard these last few years. 

I read somewhere today, “depression is treatable not curable”. It hit me hard, I broke down crying recalling all my efforts.

20301,"Every moment before it’s present. Every thought before it’s thunk. Every emotion before it’s felt. Every plan before it’s made. Every goal before it’s met. It even consumes itself. It mostly consumes itself. Feeding off of itself yet never failing to sustain.

It’s a cloud of rain reminding you that it’s ready to pour if at any moment you decide to enjoy the sun. Some days are all rain. Some days the cloud just lingers, never letting you forget that it’s there. It’s always present. It refuses to be ignored.

It reminds you to stay locked inside so that you never end up getting caught in the rain again. It reminds you not to make plans so that you won’t become disappointed when the rain washes them away. It reminds you to be content in your small space and to be thankful that you’re protected by the safety of four walls and a roof.

It’s suffocating but it’s safe. It’s confined but it’s familiar. There’s no room for growth but at least you’ll never get lost.

At first, people in your life may offer you an umbrella. But you know the umbrella can never guarantee you’ll stay dry. Even when locked away inside- the rain will at times find it’s way to you. Staying inside is the best way to minimize your risk. The rain is too much.

You can’t be disappointed by the things you never achieved if you never sought to achieve anything to begin with. You won’t have to blame yourself for being subjected to the rain if you don’t step out from under the protection of your small roof. If from time to time the rain still manages to make its way in- you can at least take comfort in knowing it was unavoidable, as you did everything you could to avoid doing anything at all.

It multiplies. The more you think about the rain, the more clouds appear. But again, it will not be ignored. The multiplying is inevitable. The more you dread the rain, the more rain comes. The more rain comes, the more you dread the rain. It’s a never ending cycle. It multiplies itself until there’s no longer room for anything but rain clouds and one day you’ll forget there was ever anything but.

It washes away everything that once was, everything that is and everything that will be. Every moment before it’s present, every plan before it’s made, every emotion that wasn’t born from the rain and every goal before it can be met. Serving as a constant reminder to stop expecting more than rain. Eventually you won’t even remember the sun, which in a way may makes the loss of it easier to bare.

But while it cleanses your tiny world of everything that can be seen, heard, felt or thought- it never washes away itself.

It’s always present. It’s impossible to ignore. You have become the rain.

20900,"This is going to sound so self indulgent because I really have managed to make a great life for myself in so many respects. Im a man in my late 30s and I have already seen and done things that very few people on Earth ever have. I have a great career making six figures. Own my own house/property. I have a great relationship with all of my family. I have cultivated so many friends over the years. I’m a rock in many peoples lives. I’m the guy people can count on to help them out with anything they need. I love people and helping people. 

I was an idiot in my 20s chasing the one that got away in a toxic on again off again relationship and when I finally thought it was all going to work out I got cheated on by her with a guy twice our age. Years later she wrote me a letter apologizing for it all. I fell into depression and let myself go after this. I came out of it and managed to find purpose in my work and hobbies. I lost 100 lbs to get in shape. And… nothing. For whatever reason I can’t find love. I’ve literally traveled to every continent on Earth, made a lot of money, taken care of my physical appearance and for whatever reason I still can’t find anyone who loves me which makes it all feel so hollow. I don’t feel like anyone owes me love, I’m just sad and depressed that halfway through my life I can’t say that I’ve ever truly received it despite trying pretty hard to find it for a long time.

Recently I started seeing a girl who I thought had the potential to be the one for months and now she has had some freak personal trauma unrelated to me but that is causing her to push me away and now I’m just sitting here in my empty house again. I wanted to have a family and every day it feels like it’s more likely it will never happen.

I’ve cleaned my house, taken a nap, done my laundry, got outside, anything that usually helps alleviate - I’ve done it. I’m in a happy marriage, financially stable, overall live a healthy lifestyle but I seem to have this constant ache in my chest and lump in my throat lately.

I’ve been wasting away to be honest. I don’t care about life, and the truly shitty thing seems to be, that nobody seems to be worth fighting to keep being. I’ve played along but it’s getting harder each day. My own dishonesty about how deep this runs has just been coming up a lot lately. I’m just always looking at the clock for time to pass, for oblivion to enter. I cannot stand existing, maybe that’s called depression, with other issues included, that just don’t seem worth solving at this point. So I’m just wondering, how is your life? How are you fairing and dealing with this? Do you have family that motivates you? Friends? Do you find ways to love life or make it work or worth it somehow? Are you ever angry?",depression

20100,"I don't like posting anything about myself online because in the long run I feel like it only makes things worse, but i need advice from people with experience. I'm 30 years old, and despite having a job that allows me to pay the bills I feel the lowest I've ever felt in my life. I'm mentally and physically exhausted the majority of the day, and despite making changes in my diet and exercise I feel completely empty.

I felt better and more alive when I spent my weekends heavily drinking, even though those nights would usually end with me having heart palpitations and feeling like I was going to die. At least when I was inebriated I could feel a spark of the happiness I had when I was younger and that feeling made me want to drink more and more just to keep that spark alive. Unfortunately, now when I drink I get panic attacks that take days for me to get over so it's not even an option for me anymore.

For the first time in my life I'm considering therapy because at this point I don't know what other alternative to turn to. The only reason its taken me this long to consider it an option is because I feel like I already know what a therapist would say to me. As pessimistic and presumtuous as it is, it seemed pointless. I'll admit It would be nice to vent to someone but is that really all there is to it? I have to be wrong.

I'm going to look for a therapist first thing tomorrow, but in the meantime I want to hear from those of you with experience. Did any of you share similar skepticism and end up surprised by the results? Thanks in advance for your input.",depression

20878,"33 this october. No friends, no love interests. And now no job. I have plenty of money saved up until i get new work..but I have no motivation. Most days i’m content to stay in my room and get lost in a book, or a game, a comic, a movie or show. Anything besides having to deal with the real world and all its bullshit and disappointments. 

 I’m socially awkward and riddled with anxiety. Constantly playing out scenarios in my head that make me feel paranoid or that nobody likes me. Sometimes i get tired of myself, my thoughts, my voice. Other times i wish i had never been born at all. I feel like the world is just too much, that i feel everything so deeply or not at all. Doesnt help that i’m on the most soul-sucking medication there is. The only peace i can think of is to not exist. But i wont do that. Wouldnt want to hurt my family. The world is unfair and cruel. Everyone is obsessed with themselves, or fame, or money. The miracle of life and we turn it into this. Constant work. Deeply saddened to see my parents still working, probably never able to retire bc of this stupid, corrupt system called capitalism. If i had the power to wipe it all away i would. 

I dunno, i just wanted to get some of this out of my head. Not looking for advice. Feel free to add to the list of bs this life throws at us.",depression

20142,"To make this short and to the point. I’ve had depression/anxiety my whole life. It’s nothing new other than with age it seems to just get worse. I’ve been through the system for help and here I am again. 
I have a 15 month old who would be better off without her depressed mother around. My whole family is effected by my moods. It’s not fair to anyone and I definitely don’t want to be the reason everyone is walking on eggshells. I grew up like that and it’s not fun and look at me…I have problems. 
I believe it’s better for me to disappear than subject my family to this terrible illness. I’ve read how having a depressed mother can effect a child. I also know first thing. I stress my husband out like no other. It can all be solved if I just leave. My husband asks where to? I don’t know, I have no one so probably the streets. Obviously he’s not ok with it but again better than subjecting everyone to this bs. It seems like a fair trade for a better life for them and I’m put out of my misery. It’s already hard enough to live with this crap to add more guilt and shame it just doesn’t make sense.",depression

It’s funny because everyone tells me I can do so much more, but is that truly so? I hate everything about everything yet have no real motivation to change. I’m just so tired all the time. 

Little background to paint the pathetic picture, I’m in my late twenties and live with my parents. I’ve had no remaining friends for several years now (for the better), have had a suspended license for 4 years, and my only sibling hasn’t talked to me in years. My parents and girlfriend are the last remaining positive things in my life, yet personal guilt blocks my appreciation of them. I honestly don’t deserve them. 

Why they haven’t discarded me like everyone else is beyond me. I’m a pathetic, self-absorbed, alcoholic blister. The only time I don’t experience crippling anxiety and the hollowness of my self- inflicted sadness is when skirting the line of a blackout. I have embarrassed my girlfriend and parents countless times. Despite my best efforts, I’m not a likeable person, even when sober. I hate that I have to not drink two days a week, otherwise the familiar beast of physical dependence comes knocking on my decrepit door. 

I’m not sure why I’m even bothering to write all this. It’s not like I’m capable or even worthy of change. I got cleaned up and worked a 12 step program rigorously for over a year in the past. Tried to convince myself that I could even make healthy friends and live a normal life. I also went on Prozac, which made only a negligible difference except for the broken dick. That facade quickly crumbled once I realized that people like me are simply not meant to be happy. I lived in nothing more than a hopeful fantasy all that time. 

In the end there isn’t much else to say. Life just isn’t fair, and I haven’t the energy to even complain anymore. The 18 yearold who locked 13 yearold me in his garage and shot me with a BB gun is a rich corporate lawyer. The highschool team-mate who regularly beat my ass is an investment manager for Merryl Lynch. If there weren’t losers like me, then there wouldn’t be winners like them.",depression

20798,"I've (25f) been going through the most stressful depressive episode i've ever been in and I can hardly get anything done. At best, I get maybe 1~2 hours of work done in the afternoon before I have an anxiety/stress/depression(???) attack and my body decides to just shut down. Literally, it's hard for me to move and i'd collapse if i try to stand, i can't keep my eyes open, and it wears me out to the point that afterwards I just lay there and try to do something low energy like reading until I get up to make sure I at least eat something and spend some time with my parents. I can usually spend a bit more time on work if I'm feeling particularly good or hobbies like music and art if I don't have another attack at night but I'm also only productive for maybe 1~2 hours before I switch to something low energy again . Really my low energy activity is mostly just reading fiction. Sometimes I'll try to play video games but that's rare nowadays. (My therapist knows all of this and we're working on it. Still gotta handle it in the meantime though). 

I'm not employed right now but I do remote volunteer work that takes probably 7~10 hours a week. I can get my work done but I feel like im seriously hanging by a thread. I'm also job searching but to be honest, I have no idea how I'll hold down a full time job. I'm not sure I can even really hold down a remote part time job truthfully. I've considered at least taking small freelance gigs but it's difficult to get going.

I feel like im making a lot of excuses since i use to autopilot pretty well through high school and college but with the intense physical symptoms I have now, I feel like my depression is more debilitating than ever. I'm kind of scared that soon I won't be able to manage anything and I'll let my life slip by. :( 



Tldr; I probably avg 1~2 hours of productivity (work and hobbies) a day, autopilot isnt working since i have physical symptoms that make it hard to move and leave me dead tired, i feel like im making excuses, and my depression feels inscreasingly debilitating.

Just wondering how you guys manage to get things done or if there's others that may be going through the same struggle.",depression

The worst part is watching everyone around me get accepted. I've got a 4.3 GPA and plenty of AP classes, but left and right everyone I know is getting accepted into schools with half the acceptance rates of the ones I applied to.

I graduated from University in 2022 (maybe it was 2021, Covid messed up my sense of time) to get a bachelors degree in Culture, Literature, and the Arts, but I am stuggling REALLY HARD to find a job. I don't necessarily need a job in that specific profession, but I do want a job that will at least make life manageable so I can eventually get my own place and move out of my parents basement. I've worked a temp job at my old University, but never had a ""real"" job where they wouldn't get rid of me after a couple of months.

20234,"I had severe depression as a teenager. It lasted for years but gradually got better. I got married, moved states, got an amazing job, bought a house, got dogs. Life was going so well. I still had my coping mechanisms but I was off medications. But in the last few months everything has been so much worse. I work a high stress job during the holidays so I normally take a nice vacation in the beginning of the year. It resets me and gets me ready for the year ahead. But this year it didn't help. 

Its been one thing after another in terms of bad things happening that I have to deal with. Between serious injuries to myself, high periods of emotional stress helping others through the darkest times of their lives, and high levels of stress with things that keep happening at work I can't keep up. Yesterday I cracked. I stayed in bed all day alternating between crying and feeling emotionally detached. Today was much the same. I'm just now feeling like I can bear to get out of bed and do anything. I have a therapy appointment set up. But it feels like I'm back to being that sad teenager with no way out. My coping mechanisms aren't working the way I need them too. Any advice to get me through this time is appreciated. Thank you, and much love to this community",depression

20761,"Hey, been a while since I posted something here. I'm 18 years old and from Brazil, been having some great moments on my life overall with some amazing moments and alot of development from therapy, but even with minor problems, the real one is that I'm probably an undiagnosed autistic guy and even if it's a low to moderate level, it makes me go nuts. This really seems like a he of a problem daily and yet I somehow manage to survive without ripping my ears off, hate how anoying this is to the point I hate using the microwave and always add an extra second just to not hear it beeping, how any sound looks like a jumpscare from a horror movie most of the time and on top of all this always happened to me on my childhood and yet no one even bothered to listen my side, calling me either a crybaby, that I was faking it. Got called alot for having no social life and yet no one seemed to care when I asked help or either seemed like they were forced to do it. 
Dunno if its autism since some people say anyone can have alot of symptons that are inside the spectre, yet aren't considered, but the good thing is that I atleast got a way to sleep better without having any noise waking me up with the new medication. Sorry if it was long, this seemed the place where I could talk about anything envolving my personal hell",depression

Hi, idk if this is in the right place but I just need to get stuff out.
I (24f) should be so happy an excited, I'm getting married next week. I love my Fiance, and I want to marry him. 
But I've had to move hundreds of miles away from my mum and my friends. 
I have BPD and probably autism, but NHS won't help me get diagnosis for either.

I haven't been working and been living with my parents becase of depression. Now because me and husband can barely afford a basic place to live I will have to work. And I want to. I want to be so capable and successful and hard working but I just want to kms anytime I think of getting up and going out.

I've only been living in my new town a week, and everytime i remember im not going home i feel so depressed. 

All my Fiance can say is he's sorry. But that doesn't fix anything or help me or comfort me at all, and my BPD shuts any suggestions he has down because substitues wont help. I don't know anyone here,   and everyone in my community is old. And whilst yes old people can make lovely friends, It's not the same.

I can't drive, afford to drive or have the mental stability to drive so I feel so lonely and depressed.

And I feel so awful for my fiance when I'm literally saying I'm depressed and I don't want to be here. 

I just want to be hit by a car or something, every day my brain says stuff like that and I'm so tired of holding it together.

I don't want to be here. And yet as always I'll carry on. I'll just ""cope"". I won't kms. But it hurts all the same.",depression

20527,"Just a personal win I decided to share. 

Dear Journal, 
  I got sick again. The same cyclical vomiting and upper stomach pain I had before. Yesterday and last night was the lworst of it. I'm just now starting to feel slightly better. 
  My biggest regret is how quickly I wanted to end my life. This wasnt a little pain by any means. The  last time this happened, I had a psychotic break in the hospital and tried to cut myself open. This time wasn't as severe or long but still, the pain got so bad I wanted to end it all. I even thought of how. But by some stroke of fate, I talked myself out of it. Citing mostly that I just wasn't ready.
  I spent the rest of the night repeating that it will pass. All storms pass, this will too. I know it sounds silly,but either by distracting myself or blind luck, I started to feel better.
I've always believed you gotta do what you gotta do. Last night, I had to survive and I did. I dont know how or even why I managed to talk myself out of it, but I am grateful. I can't say I'll always have that power. It didn't even sound like words I would say. I mean ""this will pass"", how cliché. But as the night passed and dawn broke, I knew I made it. 

Just a reminder for anyone that needs it, you're not fighting alone. We can get thru this together 💜",depression

20750,"Just came here to write down my feelings. I have a fragile mental state, and am not good with sharing my feelings with my friends or family. I think people would generally describe me as someone with a sense of humour and as having good spirits. I am able to joke and laugh, tell people I am feeling great. But I have a dark side that nobody knows because I don't want to share, as I don't want to be a burden. Usually I am able to keep the feelings away, maintain the facade and stay strong and reasonably happy. But recently, things have not been going well for me, and I think what little resilience I had got washed away.

It is becoming hard for me to stay positive, because I feel so numb inside. I am becoming less motivated to do things that I enjoyed only a couple weeks ago. I don't want to socialise anymore. I have work piling up to the point that I am completely overwhelmed, but don't feel sharp enough or motivated enough to make a start to it.  I was drifting between two friend groups, and lost one of them because I decided to prioritise the other. I feel disconnected from my family and friends, mainly because they are currently so far away. I have a bad relationship with my father, who I feel like does not care for me anymore after he started a new family. I hate the way I act, and am consumed by guilt and embarrassment when I think about my words or actions. A romantic situation I was involved with for only a month imploded, and I can't stop blaming myself, can't stop thinking about it or fully letting go. I have never handled rejection very well, and I have thought that maybe, the rejection that I received from her is the shock that caused me to crumble.

 I seriously don't know what to do anymore, and I do seems to sink me deeper into this hole that I have fallen into, unable to see any escape. Days pass like crazy, and I feel as though I am insulated, unable to feel anything but numbness. I have never sought professional help, and as an exchange student far away from home, I don't know how available that would be. Maybe someone can relate to what I am going through, and give me some advice. If you made it all the way down here, thanks for giving me your attention.",depression

20305,"16f soon to be 17. mom's a schizo, dad's not present, parents are divorced  and are both narcissists

i'm homeless because my mom believes she doesn't need a job because the king/prince of dubai is her soulmate and she'll be a millionaire soon ?????? i can't get a job either because she moves onto the next location every time i mention it. we hop from campground to couch to car to hotel and it's been this way for 6 years but her psych has deteriorated over time

barely made it through high school. i still haven't taken my 11th grade exam even though it's due soon. i haven't actually studied in years because i've had too much shit going on to focus. i did online school from 6th grade to 9th grade and have been fully homeschooled since. my brain's turned to mush. i failed every subject besides science and history so now my grades are too low to get into college. i also can't attend college because it's too much money. we literally have like 60 dollars in the bank bc someone lended it to us but it's gonna be gone soon cause my mom blows it on shit we don't need

i don't have any friends. or have anyone to talk to for that matter. i've never had an irl friend and it's been a year since i had an online friend. she has really strict rules around socialization and going outside. i'm watched like a hawk. i don't go outside unless my mom is right by my side but my dilemma is that i genuinely hate being around her because she's obnoxious and rude to everyone, but it's also my only opportunity to be part of the world instead of rotting alone inside all day. not like i get the chance to very often because she's lazy af and doesn't even like going on walks or going inside stores. she just orders things. the most i'll go outside is to walk to the bathroom across from our cabin or walk out to the car 

i'm always bored and lonely, have been my whole life basically, and it's resulted in me being completely apathetic towards everything. it's agonizing to say the least. i always feel empty and disconnected from my body and the world. the only thing that makes me feel good is maladaptive daydreaming but it's not reality. each time i accept that it's not reality i spiral further down and it feels like my head is physically ripping apart

my mom does so much more shit i won't even get into

cps is shit. cops are shit. both have done nothing but ridicule me. ruled my case as lies somehow. they shattered the only spirit i had left thinking that things would get better. nobody cares. i had one relative i could turn to and they said they'd arrest both him and me if i tried to stay with him 

i can't just leave because i don't have any resources, nowhere to stay, no money, no direction, etc and i'll probably get arrested this time

Maybe have a couple of drinks and play video games late into the night but I genuinely can’t find it in me to wanna be around them and it isn’t about them as people they’re actually very sweet and accepting wonderful people. 

They are kind hearted and patient and one of them even cooks for us sometimes it isn’t about them. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I just can never seem to enjoy being around people it’s supposed to be healing to be a part of a community to feel like you belong, to go out with friends and to get out of the slump you are in. 
 
A lot of people tell me it’s not good to lay in bed all day or to be in inside your apartment, watching YouTube and movies and playing video games alone but I genuinely feel that I don’t have the same functions that other humans do I don’t have the thing that makes me want to be around others. It just isn’t an emotionally fulfilling experience. 

I don’t feel the need to be around other people and whenever I do go out with people, I look forward to just going home and relaxing and finally breathing and doing whatever i want.
I’m not sure why maybe it’s a personality clash? Maybe I just haven’t found my “people“ or someone that really understands me to the point where I would find their company enjoyable? I’m not sure all I know is I’ve never really had a friend that I wanted to spend that much time with if it were up to me, I would go weeks maybe even months without ever hanging out with friends even though I know it might be better for me mentally if I’m around people and put myself out there and meet new people as well but I genuinely do not crave human presence in my life and the happiest or at least the most content I’ve ever been is when I’m alone reading comics and drinking coffee in my bed.

It isn’t like I don’t want to have friends I really do, when I have friends I just don’t really see their presence or company as a priority or a need in my life other than a conversation every now and then I never really seem to want to spend my free time on them.

I’ve been like this my while life even during middle school.

20771,"I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time now, and eating disorders in the past that have not fully healed.

The trigger this time was that I saw a photo my broyfriend took of me and my legs appeared enormous to me. That single thought that arised from a photo that a loved one took on me, lead to not eating in three days, self-injuries and an endless loop of feeling like shit. I feel so narcissistic and chidlish, why would my looks be at all THIS important? Still now I cannot get over it. Just seeing my legs in a photo that was taken with love. My boyfriend almost threw me out of home cos I was behaving like a fucking idiotic child.

Yet it is so hard to get out of the loop, I literally have nothing that makes me feel happy and I consider myself to be under the normal for intelligence and I don't have any special skills so I don't see a point in feeling better with myself. I feel so miserable, so useless, I only bring dark stuff to my lovely boyfriend. It's like I know how to get out of the loop (my therapist gave me many tips) but still when I am in the middle I cannot get out, my mind is racing with destructive shit that I believe and I act according to all these thoughts.

The eating disorder has already been on for 13 years and I am already 30. I never imagined at this point of my life I would still be dealing my so many instrusive thoughts and still thinkking this is such a big of an issue. Its like really, who is going to notice I put on weight? and if they do, why would it be so importnat? there are far many things more importnat than looks, but I seem to not be able to get over it anyhow. I feel like I should really die if am not skinny.

This post might be destructured as I am a little anxious right now

**TLDR**: I am 30 and still behaving like a baby and thinking my body image issues are the center of the world. I am ruining my relationship because when I get in a depressive mood, I cannot get out of it during days and I become aggressive and a total bitch with everyone.

20204,"This is a new account because I don't want it linked to my old one. I have had quite a lot of awful things happen to me in the last 10 months, which most of which I reconise is entirely my fault. I had a miscarriage and was very horribly assulted by a man which caused me to spiral, develop an eating disorder, take far too many drugs and drink too much, cheat on my love of my life and break up with him, I got sober and became friends again with my now exbf and I did a lot of healing and (now have ) celebrated 200 days sober. It had been about 5/6 months and me and my ex boyfriend at the time who were incredibly close (after I got sober) despite all the arguements and it became a bit of a situationship and we then got back together. We were together for 2 and a bit months and it was really very wonderful apart from maybe two problems and he was still healing from my betrayal, which I will always carry the guilt. He then broke up with me around 5 weeks ago and I am at my whits end. I have a 6 week thearpy course I paid for which will end in two weeks. I have now gotten it in my head I am deserving of all my guilt and pain, which I am for most of it DEFO - I am not looking for sympathy dw - but I have convinced myself walking around today that the next earth shattering or heart breaking thing I will walk into traffic or try and end my life in a way that makes it looks accidental so no one has the burden.

20638,"My depression has, at this point, taken everything that was honestly important to me in my life. My education is a mess, I can't seem to care for or bond with my friends anymore. Everything that I liked to do I stopped doing and now I have no hobbies. I have an awful relationship with my mother so that doesn't help, and neither of us cook, me mostly because I can't do anything and her idk because she's busy I guess. So my eating habits are shit, my sleep schedule is reversed at this point and my hiegene is shit too. Everything's just gross and neglected now. And I feel this insurmountable amount of guilt and shame about the fucking embarrassing shithole my life has become. And I can't bring myself to go past this feeling that I'm a waste and that I've let myself down. I had many dreams and many expectations, I realise that I'm sentimental and idealistic by nature and I really do let my imagination run wild when it comes to how life is supposed to look like. But I've never imagined this even in my pessimistic scenarios. I avoid going to my therapist because I don't believe I want to get better anymore. I don't know if I even can. And I won't let anyone help me or choose to get better. And it just feels like I'm watching this person live my life for me and I disagree with everything they're doing but somehow I'm not strong or bothered enough to stop them? I've built this cycle that keeps me afraid and frozen all the time so I never do anything that could potentially improve my situation because that requires stakes and effort and faith and I'm afraid of all of those. Now I just find myself grieving who I am which I know sounds completely ridiculous but I will literally look at pictures of me and I swear to god, I will grieve how pretty I look or how I talented I was at something or how fun a certain memory was as if I'm no longer here or not alive.

Although the last time was a while ago. I see a therapist every few weeks . But I can never get across things properly when I see her and she tends to talk more about herself .  

I have these episodes where I am so so upset and only the one family member I live with has seen this. It’s pent up frustration and sadness with my life. I know this sounds absurd but I’ll pull my own hair . Hit myself . I have massive bruises all over my legs currently because I was hitting myself. I feel crazy after and think wtf is wrong with me but in that moment I absolutely can’t describe the feelings . It’s just absolutely frustration with my life. 

I’m so lonely . I regret with all my heart not going to university last September like everyone else did . Working part time since then was ok but I have no friends anymore and the ones from school were horrible to me. Now I have no one . Loneliness is a bitch and I can’t describe how stuck and trapped I feel. 


I used to self harm with razors but I stopped idk how but I did, and I feel tempted to relapse but now I resort to hitting myself and scratching myself I wish I could get help but idk what anyone is supposed to do I’m trying to get on antidepressants that my therapist suggested but idk if it’ll help .

I’ve been laid off from two jobs and every day I just sit and procrastinate, I constantly miss deadlines for my assignments and when I do my dad gets upset and yells making me feel like the stupidest person to ever exist or my siblings crack in insensitive jokes that completely destroy my self esteem. My teachers constantly telling me that I’m behind my grade level or I’m not prepared enough for my senior year or that if I continue “on this route” I might have to retake a few classes. Even though this may sound like easy issues to some people, it really ruins me. Every night I cry and think about how terrible of a daughter or sister and student I must be or how retarded I am to be failing almost every class. Now the only thing I think about literally ending my own life because I just don’t care to exist anymore, even if I was doing good in school I’d just be on the road to living a typical boring life where I work at a job that I hate and suffer until I reach my death bed.

20182,"Needing a rant, and maybe support from people who have been through similar

I guess this is a rant? Or maybe just asking if people have been in similar situations.

Edit to add, I'm in Scotland. 

So I've been off work for a year now with severe MH, had 2 S attempts and multiple SH requiring hospitalisation last year. 

I'm on duloxetine 120mg for severe depression, underactive thyroid which I take lebothyroxine for,I have narcolepsy and take 200mg modafinil for that, and I have a blood disorder (cancer?) Currently undergoing tests. All these things major symptom is chronic exhaustion but I also have chronic pain (R knee operated on 2020 and currently waiting on L knee op), we're querying fibromyalgia. 

I applied for ADP in November last year, and submitted my part 2 in December. 
I submitted as part of my supporting evidence a short patient summary from my GP, my medication list (Inc up to date prescription repeats forms), letters from my therapist, letters from the police (involvement after S and severe SH), letters from my mental health team, letters from psych, and a letter from my GP detailing all above and support. 

I've heard nothing from ADP so today went to online chat and was told it's been picked up by a case manager (yay) , but that they've requested more SI from my GP. 

What?!?!?

What else could they need? And if they've requested that from GP it'll take months before I hear. It took my GP 5 months just to write the support letter they did write. 

So now I'm in an anxiety spiral because if they're gonna deny my claim I wish they would just fucking tell me instead of making me wait 6+months. All the while I can't afford my mortgage and I'm getting deeper and deeper in debt.

20144,"Throwaway because the people in this post have reddit accounts. I (28F) am married to a wonderful man (32M) let’s call him Mark. We have been married for 7 years now and I grew very close to his family as they live in the same city as us while my family is in another country.

His brother Maison (30M) and I grew very close and we have a great friendship, laughing together, talking about life, etc… as time went by I started noticing that i was being supportive and there for him and the opposite isnt true.

Now for a little backstory, Maison went through a very tough phase in his life and got depressed and suicidal, he went to therapy and started getting back on his feet again but he was never the same. This happened 3 years ago and after that experience he became very self-centered, inconsiderate yet very sensitive and also does not accept any type of criticism. He literally turned to a manchild. Only wants to game all day, doesnt help the people around him, is very dependent even in the smallest things. Mark is always walking on eggshells around him for this reason because he is scared that he would say / do anything that will cause Maison to relapse into depression.

I on the other hand am a little tougher on Maison. I sometimes feel like his family not saying anything when he is rude or acting like a child because they are afraid to hurt his feelings are turning him into a very immature and irresponsible man who is never held accountable.

He moved in to live with us temporarily to save some rent money till he gets his life together. He adopted a dog, and let her go because he didnt train her properly and she became aggressive with separation anxiety. Then he adopted another dog and the same thing happened again and he let him go. He wants so many things in his life but wouldnt want to put the hard work or the responsibility.

My question is, should we go easy on him because of his mental health? Or is going easy on him will make his life harder later because he will get used to life without any responsibility or accountability?",depression

20648,"My close friend and flatmate has depression, and she has in the past two days out of nowhere shut herself out from everybody, including me who prior to this hung out with her almost daily. She has also stopped going to university. I am worried and don't know how to approach trying to talk to her as she has not reciprocated any messages of going for a walk or for food. I know it may be best to leave her be but as her friend I want to at least talk to her face to face and help her with any emotional support or comfort, especially since we live in the same flat.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just knock on her door, or just leave her be and keep texting to check up on her every once in a while? I do understand that depression can sometimes be better dealt with alone as not to be overwhelmed but I cant help but feel worried for her.

20519,"I am seriously regretting my decision to go to grad school- I thought I was prepared for it, but I'm wasn't. I was an academically strong student in my undergraduate program and went straight to grad school after because I really enjoy academia. I found my education to be so fulfilling- but now the spark is completely lost.

Ever since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled, but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas- I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days- because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me, thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right now,

And I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety, but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.

I've barely submit any assignments- I keep trying to get them done. I tell myself that today is going to be the day I tackle even just one small thing, but this horrible feeling inside my chest and stomach just paralyzes me from being able to get anything done. I tell myself in 5 minutes I'll get up, it turns into 30 minutes, to 5 hours- then the next thing I know I've exhausted myself from just thinking about what I have to do &amp; I decide that I will try again tomorrow. Each time I try again, I fail.

I wish there was a way others could see how much effort I am putting in- even brushing my teeth and taking a shower are demanding tasks. Eating isn't even enjoyable &amp; food doesn't taste appealing to me- I nearly gag with every bite trying to feed myself.

I wish I didn't have to feel like this. I want to enjoy school and pursue my passions. I was so proud of how far I've come, only to let is all crash and burn now.",depression

20544,"I have a violet schizophrenic/autistic brother who SA me and almost killed me multiple times during rage or psychotic episodes. 

During these episodes, he would get violet in public. In middle school he had attacked the school cop, grabbed his gun, and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky, the cop arrested him. After that, rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. 

Here is the thing: Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me, strangle me, stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. 

A few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head, one more hit and she would have been dead. Again, they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse, how I was scared for my life. 

They said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me. I became so stressed and scared my awful father tried to put me in a group home because I said I didn't want to live there. Yet, the person who caused my distressed and harm was living at home and not in the mental institution.

I spoke to my therapist about this. She said since I'm only in my early 20s I can still press criminal charges against him. I am broken. I want to press charges but my parents will shun me. My parents help me financial since I am unable to work because of my kidney and seizure disorder. I know they would leave me homeless or try to get back at me and charge me with a stupid crime. My father was able to lie to the police operator about my mom to have her arrested and institutionalized. 

I am terrified of my father, and my mom cares more about my brother than I. She knows he raped me and hurt me, but still demands I come to his birthday or she won't pay my rent. Also, he SA my mom multiple times while I was a teen. Yet, my mom says she stays with him for his money. She would tell me thus as a teen, which is so sick to involve a child when you are staying with him.

I want to charge him so badly. My parents lied to me when I was a teenager when I wanted to go to the police. They said that the police won't help me. Finding our that my family lied to me, knew about the abuse, and now several years later learning he could have been charged is destroying me. 

I want to press charges. I have no money for an attorney.

I'd lose everything, become homeless, my mom who is the only person I care about would never speak to me again. I am having horrible flashbacks. My therapist also stated that I should be ""proud"" that I havnt killed myself, since most others would have with what Ive been through. This is after she knew I had slit my throat at 18. 

I can't stop crying.",depression

20061,"I dated someone for over 10 years of my life. My entire 20s. I never loved anyone more. We had a falling out, our relationship became toxic and even as we tried to remain friends it didn't work.

I cut her off last year at end of january/beginning of february. I assumed she had moved on and everything and stopped talking to me.

Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic. 

Instead, she was dead. Her family did not tell me. On tuesday her mother called me to tell me the news 13 months later. I am devastated. She did not deserve to die. I am so fucking angry at myself. I knew she was sick, I knew she was suicidal and I cut her off anyway. I'm angry at her family for denying me the ability to see her funeral. I'm angry that everyone else got a year to grief together and I am dealing with this loss alone.

I didn't message her for an entire year because I was convinced she found someone else and my pride wouldn't allow me to even say ""hi, hope all is well"".

20415,"so i don’t really know where to talk about this and even if no one reads this it’s okay 

so i’ve been struggling with depression and bpd for years now due to traumatic experiences i’ve had with my family (mainly physical and mental abuse) i still live with my mother who has caused a lot of pain (i was told by a therapist to just accept her because i live here, in which is the same way she dictates the household) 
anyways so i’ve been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and although i’ve seen to be getting better, my mother and i had a physical altercation in which lead me to a downward spiral. It caused problems in my relationship as i know i don’t have the healthiest means of coping, many time we would have arguments that i could not emotionally handle because my depression has been getting the best of me and i know i am to blame but bear with me 

my boyfriend and i had a fight because i snapped at him over the phone, it wasn’t his fault and i felt really bad so i apologised but he said i was just being unnecessary, i said i was sorry for being unnecessary and he said he didn’t care, eventually he said he was over it and that we were okay but it left me feeling low because i’m not in the best of mind states, i recently lost my job (and been struggling to find another because not many places are looking at the moment) and my mother has been on my head about it. my mental state has been pretty low and i’m mostly disappointed in myself, i tend to put myself down a lot as i really wanted more for myself . I had a breakdown after our fight because i felt like i was being a burden to everyone including my boyfriend, i said i felt worthless and that i was sorry he had ti deal with like this and overall just going over how i felt like life would be easier w/o me 
he said that i’m always living in this self pity and that i’m never going to get better , he said i work on his nerves (paraphrasing because he said it much vulgar) and that that’s all i do lately in the middle of my break down and i just cried harder , this was over a video call so after he said that he just watched me cry, clearly annoyed , i said we could end the call if the crying bothered him and he said just end it because i’m tired of you

And since then we've all gone out separate ways. I feel like I'm never someone's first choice. Usually people don't talk to me unless I initiate. And it gets tiring, being the only one putting effort into a relationship. It sucks, I thought I was getting along well with everyone and now I'm realizing it's the same shit.

20190,"((throwaway because a common friend follows my main account))

Some brief background info:
I have autism so I may not always understand all social cues. Neither my friend nor I live in the US.

I have a friend going through a hard time right now. He has depression and recently has been experiencing all sorts of physcial issues. He's had depression before I even met him and have never seen him this low. He also has money problems and thus can't afford treatment for his physical issues atm. 

What's the best way to support him?
I cannot support him financially since i also have almost no money.
 Whenever i talk to him he gives short and/or snappy answers and is generally in a bad mood. Whenever I talk about positive things, it feels preachy or that I'm ""rubbing happiness in his face"". Whenever i try to talk about neutral things  (basically small talk) the conversation dies off. So he's understandably a bit difficult to talk to as of late.

I admit, it's difficult and hurtful at times but I just want to know what would be the best way to provide my support. 

 Any and all clarifying questions are welcome, I just want to provide the best support I can.",depression

20921,"I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression. Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers: profesionally, academically, relationship wise. I am 27 now and things haven't really improved.

Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone, namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just ""man up"" basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.

I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid, working a job I have grown out of for years.

Relationship wise, I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.

I do not feel like an independent person, up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.

I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle, I immediately resort to these two things.

Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me. 

I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.

There have also been times...in which I contemplated suicide... but not seriously. Just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind.

a friend of mine struggels a lot since a few years. she is 59yo and about 4 years ago her mom got sick and she cared for her til the mom died. they lived in the same house. her adult daughter is on a different continent and cares pretty much for herself only -wich is ok, they have a good realationship, i just try to draw the whole picture. She lost a close friend to cancer in december, they have spent nearly every day together.
 
Since 2 years she isnt able to work because of her depression. 2 months ago she tried to explain to her doctor that she wants to work again, not fulltime, just to get back some routine in her days. doc declined. 
 
Now shes at home most of her time. Alone. Her loved cat died earlier this year. she says the whole house just feel dead to her and she is so lonley there. But at the same time she doesnt want to be around others. i know that every time i visit her she struggles and is always close to cancel, but knows that she feels a little better afterwards. 
 
she is calling for help -indirectly. i get the calls. she wants back some structure in her days. she wants to help someone by reading books for kids or a women in a wheelchair who is helpless. But she cant bring herself to do it. 
 
I dont want to push her to much. But i also have to strong urge to help her somehow. more than visit her once a week and listen to her. But i dont know how. i cant imagine the situation she is going throuht. i cant relate to that feeling but i want her to get better and be that brave, wise, strong and creative person she was before. she wants help but i dont know how. she cant bring herself and i dont wanna be to pushy.

20848,"For the past 4 years I've (18m) struggled with depression, I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents (a violent fuckfest) when I was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication (ritalin) by snorting it.
Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

20918,"I've done a lot of horrible things to people in my past. I'm a pathological liar that has constantly manipulated people to make sure either myself or the other person didn't get hurt (at least in the moment). I've used people and thrown them out like trash after I was done. I've dealt with ADHD, anxiety, and depression for over a decade now.

My ex and I broke up almost 7 years ago. It was a horribly messy and terrible break up that caused me to be suicidal (we both made mistakes). There was never any closure and it always felt like it should have ended differently. It often felt like she felt the same as well...at least back then (think she might resent me now).

Been having some real down moments lately and I've been thinking about my ex a lot. I'm still attached to those days and emotionally often feel stuck there. There's still a giant piece of me that belongs to her.

I've been in a fairly healthy relationship for the past 5 years but I have quite a few things I lied about in the early parts of our relationship. I feel like it's so unfair to her. It's not fair that I'm with her and emotionally stuck with my past or that I've lied to her. It's not fair that the thing I desperately want to talk about is my ex so I avoid that trauma with her.

Any advice or thoughts?",depression

20081,"My mortality recently hit me for real, and it's been sending me into a deep depression. Everything feels utterly pointless, because no matter how well I live, I'll die and not remember any of it. There won't be any legacy of me, since the universe itself will die in the end. Nothing has any point to it, we're just here to plug our ears and pretend that we're never going to die, despite also being certain of it. My whole life just fell apart, and now I can barely enjoy things knowing it'll all be gone. I keep mourning my friends and family, knowing everything I do with them amounts to nothing. No professional help or medication can change these things. Existence is just a prison where they dangle all these wonderful things in front of you, and then remind you that you'll be dead and none of it will have mattered. There's no afterlife, no legacy, nothing. This feels like the cruelest joke imaginable. I have zero motivation to pursue a career, knowing it's all for nothing. I can barely enjoy my hobbies, knowing they're just a distraction and won't be remembered by anyone.",depression

20689,"Hi guys. First time on this sub. Im here because i cant talk about this with anyone anymore. My gf is tired of hearing my depressed talk. Family too. I don’t blame them. I’ve always suffered from anxiety but its been a year since I’ve been experiencing depression. Im not diagnosed, not been to therapy, Ive been broke and have to eat too. But its an overwhelming feeling. 

I feel tired, i dont wanna do anything. Its hard for me to enjoy anything. I feel like Im a failure. Im about to be 30 and I dont have shit, my career as an artist sucks, im not getting no clients and also its extremely hard to put myself out there cause I feel like im So miserable people will be able to tell. I dont wanna see people anymore, I hate to being asked how im doing. I feel it’s exhausting for my loved ones to deal with me and I cant really blame them. It’s exhausting for me too. Maybe they dont have the tools to understand. Im never hungry anymore.    

Something triggered me yesterday, a friend of mine is getting engaged and i hate myself cause I really wanna be happy For them and I am. But also served as a reminder for me: im in a very low point in my life and I don’t know how to get out.  It makes me feel so miserable when I think of how miserable i ended up to be. If that makes sense.  

And ive tried to do certain things. Learning new things. To distract myself. But i still have this overwhelming sadness on me and I really try to ser a way this will get better but seems to only get worse. I really dont see the right path. My dreams and aspirations are all broken and I can only cry when thinking about them. And i know there’s plenty people in probably worse situations than myself and I feel like maybe I shouldn’t be complaining. But i dont know what to do. Theres so many layers to this. I often ser my belongings and think of whatll people do with them if I die. 

I try to imagine the world without me and itll really wont be missing anything. Im thinking about my death every day now and Im afraid. Im writing this here cause I dont feel I have people to talk about this anymore and just wanted to let it out. I tried t summarize it as much as I could.",depression

20386,"Hi everyone, M25 here

I'm currently living in Lebanon where we have been suffering from a very bad economic crisis. Our currency has been devaluating at a rate where the prices go up every day.
Due to that crisis, most people my age have been immigrating and looking for jobs abroad.

I am currently getting paid a livable wage, can't complain there. I can go out to restaurants, and pubs and do activities when the majority of people can't. Note that my salary isn't considered high, I have friends who earn double and triple my income.

I majored in business administration so finding a job abroad, unlike my engineer friends, is next to impossible.

I am tired. Tired of living each day the same as yesterday. Tired to see more of my friends leaving. Tired of being alone. I'm stuck in a mental loop. Most of my friends are living their life, travelling with each other, and making memories while I'm stuck here.

I am very close to the girl I like, but she doesn't know, and seeing her miles away from me is heartbreaking. I can't make a movie knowing it will be agonizing for us to start a relationship long-term while being in my current state. Knowing she is out there spending time with our friends, making memories with them when I can't be there is crushing me more.

I was heavily depressed for several years when I was younger and managed to overcome it and be happy for a while. It seems like the depression is creeping up again.

I used to be a blanket without seams, a silk cocoon of happy dreams. Now I'm a quilt, no square the same, a patchwork of pleasure and pain.

I feel useless. Each breath I take is meaningless. Breathing is not living. I want to live. I want to be happy.

I am not suicidal. I want to overcome it. But death wouldn't be so bad right now.",depression

20442,"I contacted him in the hopes that he would let me stay with him so I can get a job in Massachusetts since I don't like living in Texas with my mom who is also abusive.
I've been texting him and he keeps demanding respect from me and said that me saying ""hey"" to him through is disrespectful and that I should call him sir, even though he says hey to me whenever he calls me, he thinks he has power over me despite me being 18. He's currently renting and moving to an apartment in Gloucester Massachusetts with his other family members for us to live in, I bought a mattress and a bed frame on amazon and shipped it to his address there, today I asked him if he could take another picture of my mattress since it arrived a few days earlier and he blew up at me, asking me why I don't trust him because my bed is already there and telling me I shouldn't disrespect him. Considering this interaction its pretty easy to tell that he would yell at me for the smallest thing if I went there, it wouldn't surprise me if he hit me too, he's like the last person I could rely on and it turns out he's just an angry piece of shit.

Althought I should blame my mom for being a whore and cheating on her husband with my dad and bringing me into this hell.
Everyone around me, even other adults and therapists tell me that I need to forgive her because she's my mom despite her beating me since I was younger for no reason, watching me get sexually assaulted as a child and making me believe this is all my fault, Ive been trying to be open minded but I cant help but believe that christians are all fucking disgusting pigs that shouldn't exist since my family is full of christians who do what they do for ""god"".

I bought a rope a few days ago in hopes that I'd have the courage to hang myself, but I'm scared, my birthday is in 5 days, would it be better to try it then? I might cause permanent damage to my throat if I fail, have ti be hospitalized but its better to try, then I'll have the courage to end it all completely, if anyone knows a good place or forest in Fort Worth Texas where I can hang myself without anyone coming to my aid I'd appreciate that, although I doubt many are gonna read this.

I'm kinda desperate as well cuz I said that I was going to kill myself to a suicide hotline person out of anger lol, although it's a good thing I used a fake name, but if they arrive to my house and figure out it's me they'll throw me in a psych ward again, instead of the person who ruined my life, I don't want know if I want to go to Massachusetts anymore, I just can't take any of this seriously anymore.
I had another account where I'd make posts begging for someone to kill me or r*pe me, in hopes that some deranged human being would agree, but I've had no luck. If you want to motivate me to end my life please dm me.",depression

20019,"Please help me. 

I am so exhausted. For as long as I can remember, probably from about 5 years old, I have been hideous. 

I was an extremely shy kid and had selective mutism, so I was always self conscious. I just can’t remember not being this way. When I started elementary school, kids would constantly comment on my looks. They compared me to skeletons, zombies, and dead bodies. The few friends I had were  told “Don’t be friends with her, she’s too ugly for you, you can do so much better.” I wasn’t allowed to sit with anyone in the cafeteria in middle school and I had to stay in the library away from everyone. People left notes in my locker calling me all sorts of names. In high school people just ignored me and I was so lonely. Then at home my parents would occasionally get angry and call me a lazy pig.

I know people have had it worse, so the worry of me being too dramatic makes it even more unbearable.

I’m going to graduate college soon. I’ve never been in a romantic relationship, any men have just taken advantage of me. However I am extremely lucky to have a few supportive friends who have tried to help me. 

Since less people actively hurt me nowadays, I expected this to get better. But if anything it’s getting worse. My nose is crooked, my lips are uneven, one of my eyes is smaller than the other. I have crooked teeth despite constantly wearing my retainer. My skin is horrible and I have this weird skin discolouration resembling a mustache that I have never been able to get rid of. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have been to therapy, I have tried body neutrality, meditation, anything you can think of. Nothing helps. I spend my days obsessing over my looks and my nights crying myself to sleep. I alternate between staring at myself for hours trying to figure out what I did to deserve to be this ugly, to having to shower in the dark and avoiding mirrors because I can’t stand to look at myself. It is utterly exhausting to hate myself this much. 

I know deep down looks aren’t everything. But being pretty would be so much easier. I don’t understand why I was dealt these cards, why I have these disgusting genes. I know other people suffer from this, but they all have redeeming qualities. I am a monster. And I need to be beautiful. I can’t stand anything else anymore.

I’m sure this post is all over the place and I apologize, it’s just another one of those nights that I can’t even think straight because I’m so preoccupied with hating myself. I’ve come on Reddit as a last hope because I don’t know how to move on from this. If anyone has any advice or suggestions about what to do please let me know. I’m begging for any relief.",depression

Go see a Pyscologist while in school, I test very high on the beck depression test. Therapist says I should ask a doctor for medicine.

20686,"I am exhausted. The thought of getting out of bed most days feels extremely difficult. The thought of making myself food and eating feel impossible. I used to not be able to go to sleep hungry, but more recently, i do it every day. If i am tired i am going straight to bed even if i am starving. Sometimes when i take vitamins my brain thinks that is enough to keep off my hunger while i sleep. 

A few months ago i completely lost my appetite and didn't eat for over a day. It went away and my appetite came back, but recently I've been eating only one or two meals a day. Not because i want to lose weight. I just am so tired. 

If it's not fast food i can barely eat it. I can't eat a lot anymore. Sometimes the smell of food is sickening even if I'm hungry. Most of my meals are fast food. 

I am constantly hungry, but it doesn't bother me as much anymore.

20393,"I had gone through a lot in the past 2 years, facing a horrible dispute with my parents (mom,stepdad,and dad) and being thrown into a mental hospital after a school got scared of me. My parents destroyed my relationship with my ex and my social life, making me mentally snap or something. Afterwards, then figuring my dad had manipulated me and ridding of him from my life. I took lots of drugs I wasn’t supposed to take after everything that had happened and nothing afterwards has been the same. 

I had realized I no longer was happy about the things that made me happy, rather emotionless. This occurred after me getting out of the mental hospital , furthering getting worse after a cycle of rad-140 with mk677 and a Benadryl overdose of 1200mg in the span of two days. I have a new relationship, life, no more problems it seems like, but I feel no joy and no happiness towards my daily actions and accomplishments as well as interactions with other people. I go through my day seeing my current girlfriend and  friends or getting something done but never feel completed, like I did something but forgot cause I just did it to do something. I also recognized how much I had dissociated, it felt like all I think about is the wrong and past because it’s what I can’t fix that was clearly my fault at some times. I think too much about what people have done to me, making me stay away and never invite people over. I often blur out and feel as if I’m in my own world where nothing exist for seconds up to hours, even sometimes forgetting who was talking to me or what I was doing.

I feel insane, I have extremely bad mood swings. No I never was diagnosed with any sort of mood disorder, but I was on abilify because of alleged homicidal ideations. I have extreme anger, enough to cause myself and others harm. I do not have any explanation to why I have these feelings and want an explanation. I have cut myself before because of the anger towards myself and others and don’t want to be in the same place. I have had unexplained episodes before that felt descriptive to being manic episodes but never fully closed to be, just because they said it was the mood stabilizers that caused it. The last time I felt homicidal ideations was unintentional and was two weeks ago.

I started to stop caring about everything. Problems I had, my grades, my girlfriend, my ex, my goldfish and my dog it didn’t matter. Every problem was the same because I felt as if nothing could feel as close as painful as the things I heard and saw from the past 2 years specially and even further in the past with trauma. I would be in near death situations even with drugs with almost dying from multiple overdoses, with the worst being Benadryl. I miraculously have woken up every time just glad I had experienced something out of worldly and disconnected more than actually caring that I almost died. The Benadryl overdose itself, actually made this affect worse. After two weeks and a half of recovery from it, I felt so disassociated and had no feelings towards anything in a bad or negative way similar to what I was talking about earlier but worse, making me stop caring about everything. Somewhat it wasn’t the worst, considering the days that would viewed the worst by others was just another day for me just like the rest.

Random thoughts of apologizing, being empathetic, but then being hateful and sad and homicidal. Also sort of like mood swings, it’s just an array of unexplained thoughts that never get told to the people I’m thinking about or anyone actually. And example of this goes as such, I will feel happy I had feelings towards someone and remember what they’ve done but then feel extreme opposite feeling such as pain,anger,fear,sadness, and homicidal ideations. I had these feelings and still do as they can happen anywhere, I’ve had them for years in-fact. Do they mean anything? 

Thank you for your time and efforts of reading my post. If you have any explanation to why these things and happening and what they are, feel free to comment whatever you’d like to.",depression

I don’t have any major problems or stressors in my life either, I’m just depressed for no reason 2-5 days per week.

Does this mean that my anti-depressants aren’t working, or do I just kinda need to suck it up? I’m scared to try new anti-depressants bc of the withdrawals and potential worsening of my depression, so I’m not sure what the best thing for me is to do.",depression

I could really use some help right now, cause I'm so lost.

I've been drinking and smoking so much for the past few weeks, its really starting to hurt me really bad. But, I think I just lost something special. So basically, I was in a relationship with this girl for around 4 months. We hit it off real good, right from the start. We used to hang around uni together, and it felt so perfect. I had to break it off with her, since I wasnt really looking for anything serious, and she insisted on only that. Ever since the beginning, and even during our relationship, she only prioritized friendship over us. It was always friends, friends, friends for her. We said we'd balance both, but somehow she didn't do anything much about us. She also had a lot of guy friends, that made me feel so bad about, but I never got the nerve to tell her about how that made me feel. Seeing her dancing with all those guys post breakup, sparked a different kinda anger in me. I know I ended this, but I was really hoping that we would atleast stay friends. I told her how much she meant to me, and even begged her to stay. 
I just ended up blocking her. Her birthday, is in a months time. Should I even bother wishing her? 

What do you think my next move should be? 
Should I just let this die slowly? 
Should I move on? 
Is it okay for me to feel this way?",depression

20275,"

I (28m) have been suffering from depression since childhood when I was 15. I was diagnosed with OCD and depression/anxiety by doctors and had been taking fluoxetine regularly. I was good for last couple of years. Then I went to Australia for my further master’s studies from my home country and it started reoccurring again. I started feeling lonely and the suicidal thoughts started again. I could not get it out of my head at any time. So, I returned to home country after I thought I could not take too much. After consulting doctors I got medicine change. Now I am worried if I should go back or not. I am too scared to go back there now. I think I will eventually commit suicide one day or another. My family has invested money and want me to go there but I am unsure if I will be good there. What can I do in this situation? Please help",depression

20011,"I'm a 25 year old man who's never had a girlfriend or sex in his life and since yesterday I decided to give up trying. I have a very good life, amazing family and friends that understand and support me no matter what I do, I have a job that I enjoy and coworkers I get extremely well along with. I don't consider myself ugly, I think I'm just mid. I nurture many passions, am very extroverted and outgoing, and I believe I'm quite smart, but especially in these last 3 years I've been feeling extremely hollow and sad, and the reason why is no matter what I do or how much I keep improving myself, I seem to have no luck with girls. Yesterday I went out with this great girl I met in university 2 years ago, which I've been texting on and off with. I thought she had interests in me since she was the one asking me out, but as I later found out in the day she had been seeing this guy for about a month where she is studying. I promised myself to go into that ""date"" with no expectations but of course there was hope things would go well. However, as per usual, I had to go back home and cry myself to sleep for the 100th time and I'm just tired of this endless repeating cycle.

20973,"I listen to my cousin and siblings...they all have their life mapped out and planned. For me, I was planning on not having a future, so I never actually made a road map to success for my life. Sometimes I wonder if it's as obvious to see that as I do.

For the longest time, I thought I would d1e before age 18, so I put off thinking about what I'd do after school. Then when I hit 18 and was still alive I just did the bare minimum to stay afloat, I kept biding my time like that hoping I'd have a spontaneous heart attack or something because of how unhealthily I treat my body.

But yet I'm still here ... why? 

How come hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to live died at an early age, but I who want to die am still here when I've not taken care of myself in so long... why, why, why?

I don't understand why the world is doing this to me. Even though my thoughts of death have been pretty passive, it's not like they don't affect me at all. Everytime I get my tiny paycheck and see that I don't have enough to afford more than 1 meal a day I just want to die more. All I asked for was a job that I don't hate, that pays me a wage to live on my own...back in my parents day it seemed like that was actually doable relatively easily from the stories they both tell. Why is that not the case anymore? Or is it just me?

Again I ask, if the world wants me to live so much, than why make it so goddamn hard to actually live??? 

I'm so fcking tired of living. Nothing here is worth it. I hate this fcking world. I hate every single person on this planet. I hate my stupid job. Hate my stupid boss. I hate how everything revolves around money. I hate the society humans created. I hate myself for not just being born a normal person. 

Fck I wish someone would kill me. People die everyday, why won't someone just kill me?",depression

20870,"I am only 16. I have 4 siblings and I have just my mom, that’s all. My dad has been in and out of my life for several years and in some cases was only there in benefit of his own self. He left us when we lost our house, leaving us with nothing but our broke down minivan. Which a couple years later, he stole and stranded in Florida with every liquid in it siphoned out of it. at this point we were living in a Duplex. My mom had a tiny ford focus left because he “gave” it to her because he took our van. may i remind you that she has five kids. Now, this is only one of many things he’s done to fuck our family over. The only thing he’s ever done is benefit himself. If my own FATHER is that selfish.. how could the rest of the world not be just as selfish. how could i ever trust anybody but myself. i’m pushing everybody away and it’s all my fault. maybe i’m being selfish? idk i’m typing as i’m thinking and i really just don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t want to exist in a world where i can’t even trust my own dad.",depression

20460,"I screwed up. For the past 6\\7 years depression and anxiety hit me hard on and off. Due to loneliness and the want for a relationship.

The past 5 years iv been on and off several dating apps with zero success, adding to my depression.

Fast forward to just over a week ago and i finally match with a girl in my own town, we talk for a week and exchange snap. that day I finally meet her at a slight house gathering / party and im up all night talking and having a laugh for the first time in what i felt like was forever. 

then last night i did something incredibly stupid. We had been talking pretty much non stop on snap ever since and she goes to a local pub with her friends and stops replying to me (fair enough, she can have fun) then sends me a snap saying shes going to some friends house and half an hour later another snap of her extremely drunk on the toilet saying ""im fucked"" and i immediately start to worry. I ask if she is ok, if she is safe and has people with her and she doesnt reply. I try to call 4 times with no answer then 5 minutes later she sends a very inaudable snap that i dont even know what she was saying, almost spitting saliva everywhere and my worry gets worse.... 

For some reason In my manic worry i decided to get in my car and go to the house we met in origionaly because i didnt know where she was and they might have.. turns out she was there and in her extremely drunken state was wondering why i there when she was just trying to have some fun.

I tried to explain but she just wouldnt listen, i apologized this morning but even though she said she still wanted to talk to me, she has been very distant and not messaged me back all day...

20342,I'm 14 and I just wanna die. I have a therapist and shes nice and all but shes doing nothing. I still wanna die. None of my friends ever wanna hang out with me and it makes me feel worse. I've been trying to act more happier if that's the problem but I don't think that's working. I'm just so tired of everything. My dream is to explore the outside and abandoned places but even if I could get out of my bed my parents would never let me get past the front door. Recently two guys at my school said I was fine and I thought that was nice but then my friend told me they were trying use me for my body. It disgusted me. I'm 14. I feel unsafe at school and at home. I know my family loves me but I feel unsafe sometimes. My parents say I dont have depression when I've literally overdoesed on meds just to sleep. They say I have too many problems. Not my fault you probably smoked while you were preg mom. I hate saying all this but its the internet and you dont know who i am. Anyways I wanna kill myself and I dunno what to do .,depression

My parents are going to court soon for alleged threat to kill charges and i was forced to testify against my mother. The court date is 6 days from now and I'm losing my mind, I never ever want to hurt people especially my family, I always tiptoe around them and put them before myself, but no one ever does the same for me, no one even realised the state I'm in. They only care about themselves and yet I always get blamed for their problems, worries, misfortunes, etc., I've only ever tried, I try so hard to make everyone feel safe and happy. I ran away from home, start abusing substances, lost so many people, have internal self loathing, deal with traumatising memories of getting constantly molested by my older brother, started self harming and not eating. life is a fucking cycle of everlasting pain.",depression

20543,"I am also a very isolated person. I’m a first year teacher; tomorrow is my formal, which is one of the most important days of the year for my career. I get evaluated on my performance.

I’ve never missed a day of work until this month; I was so sick that I was sent to the ER. That was two weeks ago. Then I couldn’t chew, my wisdom teeth were gnawing at me, and the gum over the tooth got infected. Now I have a cold as well.

Within this time, I’ve lost my gold chain, an invaluable item with massive sentimental value. I received it from my parents when I graduated from my masters. I wore it everywhere.

I haven’t been sleeping. I’ve cut off the few friends I have entirely for weeks. My co-workers know something is off, but I put on a smile at work.

I am absolutely broken. I’ve had close to no sleep these past few days. I’ve found no enjoyment in anything and have had no appetite.

I haven’t been happy for years. I have isolated myself due to the pressures of work; and have lost a lot of friendships and relationships because of it. But these past few events have been stacking on and I don’t know if I can take this anymore. I have rigorously searched everywhere for this gold chain, but I think I’ve lost it at the gym or at the library on Monday. I’ve called both.

My thoughts are everywhere, I apologize if this is not comprehensible.

I’m been sad for months due to other things but it feels like I have a curse, or a bad omen following me this month. I don’t know what to do, or who to talk to. I can’t speak to my friends, it’s so embarrassing. My life feels like it’s been falling apart at a slow and steady pace and this is the huge finale.",depression

20626,"Hello.

TW: SUICIDE; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY.  


I want to start this off by saying I'm F15.

  
Ever since I was young, I dreamt about having an exceptionally great life. I dreamt of finding the love of my life, being rich, etc.  


Lately, I've seen my brothers getting that kind of life, and also lately, I was met with anxiety.  


I barely can't sleep at night, I'm extremely depressed, because I just have no hope in the future.  


Like, I feel like I'll never live the life I want, or find the love of my life, because I feel unloved. I feel, I don't want this to sound stupid, but I feel way too smart for some people, yet too dumb for others.  


I'm extremely depressed. Like, I hate how everyone is living their best lives, and I'm stuck in my home with my mentally ill  jobless 

  


  


  
mother, depressing, unloved, without anyone, cause I practically have no friends.  


And my brothers just have their own life.  


So I'm truly alone.  


And I have no hope, no will, no fun.

20802,"He has done everything for me. He has taught me everything, physical and emotional stuff.

He dropped his dreams of working as an engineer just so he can help my mom’s small business and watch over me easily

He used to smoke but quit right before I was born

He used to be in a gang in Vietnam but dropped all of that just to go to the US and start a family, he tells of how gangs of kids in their school would jump the fence and literally start fighting and shoot at each other with marbles using slingshots

He tells me stories of his childhood and how at one point at my age (18) he fought off 2 guys and defended his mom by throwing his bike at them

He is very easy-going and understanding. Street smart

He literally cooks for me every night even though I already know to cook for myself and every weekend we go camping, fishing, or etc

BUT. 

So far in my life, he has been my only friend and it feels like I failed him. I’m a nobody, I’m not smart or attractive. I’m not an ivy student. I’m mediocre with no ambition and going to community college. How can my father have this exciting life and look at me in the eye and still say he’s proud of me and loves me? How can he look at a kid who has never once been complimented by a stranger and call him handsome? Or how can he call a kid who never got a 4.0 or any academic award smart? Why does my father love me so much? It would’ve been so much easier to just end it all but he has to love me and make me stay. As I’m writing this I’ve been crying so much, I was so numb for months but suddenly during my 18th birthday and this post it’s all pouring out, it’s pathetic, I would never want him to see me like this. I’m a disgrace who will end the bloodline of smart and attractive doctors, soldiers, and farmers. No girl will want a guy who is this connected to his father, is there such a thing as a “dada’s boy”?

We are trying to start a family and if I show signs of depression, what kind of confidence does that give him for me as a mother? He knows that I'm having a hard time right now and he is just trying to go on like everything is fine. What can he do? I'm fine and I have been for several years without the aid of medication (but I have continued therapy. I don't see him again for over a week though). Before, when I would get depressed, I was able to keep to myself and process it on my own. But now, I can't do that because of my new life.

20266,"the more I learned about nutrition the more I applied it to my diet, then one day I couldnt afford healthy foods and had to eat processed foods and a few times had fast food because it was better than declining and getting no calories at all. 

by the end of the first day I was doing worse again. I didn’t notice the correlation until a week later when I could get healthy food again and saw the recent things I ate (I’ve been keeping track to do the math on how much nutrition I was getting)

by the end of the day after eating healthy foods again, not even getting close to the proper amount for my age and weight, just having some I felt noticeably better. I was more productive,able to focus a bit more, moving wasnt something I had to work up motivation for, and I didn’t have to spend as much time getting myself out of the ‘I wanna lay here until I start to decay’ kinda mind.

its kinda soul crushing and liberating at the same time. after a childhood of depression, trauma, neglect, then a few years of pure hell and not feeling any of the positive things even for a moment, I actually have control over one of the things thats contributed to life being unbearable. 

but now I’m realizing if baby me had healthy food options and someone to explain nutrition, it wouldnt have been as unbearable. to what extent, I don’t know. its too depressing to imagine. 

anyway the point is, pls prioritize your personal nutrition. I’ve tried so many things my entire life to feel okay, but without the components it needs, your brain just cant do very well. I tried to eat as healthy as possible as I got older, but even the seemingly healthy options I had available to me still left me very deficient. 

(obviously malnutrition isnt the only thing that causes depression, but it has a huge effect. a lot of foods are marketed to seem healthy even if the producer is cutting every possible corner to make as much money as cheaply as possible. with how prominent that is, you should look closely at the actual amounts of nutrition in the things you eat and drink)",depression

  And also I hate that everything that I do it seeem like I'm the worst at it, even if it's just me and one other person, they will always be beter than me, and I was talking about that with one of my techers and she said ""then what do you like?"", nothing, literally everything that I do is because my mom wants me to do it and I'm too afraid of making her sad/angry by saying that I don't like it.

I don’t know if a month is too short to know or if should be seeing a little improvement by now.

Earlier this week my friend told me something and that was the first time my brain went silent for months. It felt weird, but after that, I feel no joy anymore. Before that, it was hard to feel sometimes but it was there, but now it's rarely there in the first place. I do not want to be like this, I've just been slowly getting worst as time passed and I use to believe that it would simply get better, but it's like every other week some bullshit that ruins me is revealed and I've become practically numb to it.

20691,"I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I went to college just because I couldn't see myself working, I was able to get into my dream college, but not on the course I wanted. They rejected me because there was too many people. I do ""enjoy"" (mostly just tolerate) the subject I'm studying, but I hate the thought of actually putting in hours of work just to get a passing grade. When I get home, I can't think of anything but sitting down and watching something, stop thinking about my real life that has nothing to offer. I don't study at all. I used to draw every day and I must say I'm pretty good at it, but I just don't see the point anymore. My friends are not interested in my life whatsoever, even though I'm always asking how they are doing and if they need any help I don't remember the last time somebody texted me just to talk. My parents say they love me, but I can't really believe it thanks to their lack of interest in my childhood. Money is not a problem for me, they never said that they want me to pay them, but I feel like I should put in at least a little bit of money. I got sick two days ago and all I hear when my mother gets home is that the dishes are not clean. They ignore my confessions (I'm trans), get mad at me and then say that I'm lazy for sitting and not doing enough... Which is kind of true. All I do everyday is to think that one day it will get better, but it's hard to keep going. I can't look in the mirror, there are days where I just don't eat because I don't see the point, I don't take showers, I don't take care of my face anymore. I just feel like an intruder in this world. Useless. Piece of trash that's just thrown around.

20765,"I'm 21 yo and I'm tired of what I'm studying (Computer Science), I don't find it interesting that much, I find it stressful and the job market is extremely competitive. There is just so much fcking information to learn in cs it's absolutely crazy when people say that you always have to learn in this field they weren't joking. Most of the material I will just forget quickly after a semester. Luckily I am in community college so I haven't spent really any money on this degree but I have spent a shit ton of time on it tho. Despite all that time spent already, I feel like it won't help me that much if I don't start to seriously study more but I just can't bring myself to. I don't really know what I want to do with my life but I do kinda like my job in retail even though for many people it seems like a shitty job and it kinda is but at least it's an easy job without too much stress tbh. Night shifts are the best because there are no managers so I sometimes just chill after finishing my tasks for like an hour. I can even come in high and do my job easily. But there really is a social pressure to do something better with your life and I get it I really kinda don't want to do this forever but at the same time even if I somehow get a job in my field I feel like this field would just be too stressful for me. I have thought of other options than retail that don't require a degree but I just can't try getting into them because I have to finish this degree first since I only have a bit left before finishing.",depression

20948,"I don't know how to say this, I want to get this off my chest.

I have recently been released from a psychiatry after half a year and am now at a place where I have to do almost nothing, I didn't even do anything to get there. I just have to go there in the morning and leave after 5 hours. And I am too fucking incapable of even doing this. How the fuck am I supposed to achieve anything if I already fuck up at getting out of bed. I haven't stood up on time once since I left the clinic.

I can't talk to people, I can't not look like a damn newborn piece of shite that has no life experience at all in the public and I can't fucking do anything a normal person would without getting overwhelmed or getting exhausted. I am at my limit from basically nothing, so how am I supposed to achieve anything? I am out of school (which I barely managed to survive) and don't have much time left before I have to leave my fathers place (who is also responsible for me even having anything to do, which I don't appreciate nearly enough and who puts way too much energy into keeping me afloat) and move very far away. I don't have the motivation to wake up in the morning for anything, as it all feels unnecessary and hopeless. There aren't even people I care for, not even my parents or something. And the handful of ""friends"" I have only talk to me when no one else is available. All of my school friends stopped talking to me the moment I left school. I had a girlfriend, but I didn't feel a bit of empathy at all, which I broke to her a few months later. Now I yearn for the warmth I lost after that, which I probably won't experience ever, because I am, on top of all that, the most hideous, insecure, retarded fat piece of shit you'll ever see.

I don't know what to do at all. I don't know who to talk to and how. I don't know if I can do this much longer, for I have no reason to do it. There is nothing that makes life worth living, as I don't have any interest or motivation for anything. I have so many problems, that I can't list here, that feel like they'll follow me to my grave. I need help. Or someone to talk to. I don't know.",depression

A friend recommended I begin with my regular primary care doctor, but I am unsure of this. Are PCPs able to diagnose all of these issues, some, or none? At what point would my primary care doctor likely just send me to a psychiatrist rather than diagnosing me herself?

20432,"So I am a 36 year old male. I have had depression on and off my entire life. More on than off, but my off periods were fantastic. I was capable of pure joy. Energy. Zest. I could be the person that lights up a room. Sorry to toot my own horn. I have always, however, had health anxiety. Worried about this and that, many medical tests, etc.

Over the last year, other than the 2 months I was on Zyprexa (which I guess should be very telling) I am exhausted beyond belief. I am crying all the time.  I almost never feel well-rested. I want to sleep all day. But even when I try to nap I rarely fall asleep. I just lie there and remain exhausted. Physically so exhausted. Last year I had a stupid pulmonologist (sometimes they dabble in ""sleep medicine)  suggest to me that I had narcolepsy. As a person with health anxiety, this was terrifying. I got 3-4 separate medical opinions, ALL of them from major Universities. They all said I didn't even close to have narcolepsy, and that It was my depression causing it. My tests (overnight sleep study and daytime nap study) weren't close.  I didn't believe them. I was in denial. **I think because I used to have times when I felt great and the depression lifted, this had to be something different.**

However, if I try to look at things objectively I have to see that in the last year, I have become a caretaker for my mother with ALS who is rapidly progressing, I have become more isolated and hang out with friends less, and haven't been working on my passion (music) as much. 

Has anyone else gone through *depression denial* and tried to find a medical explanation for their somatic symptoms (lethargy, exhaustion, brain fog, crying all the time) only to get every medical test in the book and have all doctors (and friends and family that know you best and love you) tell you its depression?

side note: I went for a run (while crying lol) yesterday for the first time in two years and it totally took away my brain fog. I still feel tired, but I feel clearer. That was new.",depression

I feel like  I wasted the first 23 years of my life and I am terminally behind socially and will never catch up (part of me does not want to). I am stuck in a never ending cycle of anxiety and sadness. Alcohol, in the rare times I’ve used it, calms me down. It makes the anxiety surrounding my circumstances dissipate.  I don’t see how making drinking a habit will worsen my life. Usually alcohol ruins your relationships, but I already don’t leave the house or have much human contact. It stops you from solving your problems, but I already am doing nothing about them. It poisons your body physically but I don’t care about my physical health.

20965,"(tw for mentions of sexual (specifically CSA), physical, and emotional abuse, incest, suicidal ideation, abandonment, grief, parental loss, and harrassment. let me know if i need to add anymore)

not in the suicidal way (ok maybe a bit). i *LITERALLY* feel like it was against the universe for me to be born and now I'm living a waking nightmare due to going against nature

my dad almost got in a fatal crash years before i was born and my mom had multiple miscarriages before having me

i was born early and when they xrayed me (because i was having trouble breathing) my intestines were tied. i was quickly flown to another hospital and when they xrayed me again i was suddenly fine.

i think this was all a warning sign

here's why i think I'm cursed:

since then i have been sexually abused (exclusively by different family members), emotionally abused, physically abused, neglected, got ptsd from medical malpractice, been abandoned veryvery suddenly by multiple people i have known for years, diagnosed with over 6 different mental disorders (there's probably more waiting to be discovered as well), and lost my stepdad due to a fatal accident on Christmas day 2022. 

since then his entire family has been harrassing us and trying to take his dogs from us out of purely spite. his mom thinks my mom is at fault (he had 100% brain death and my mom gave them the ok to take him off the icu) and she admitted to my mom she's trying to make me more suicidal so that i kill myself not because she has anything against me personally, but because my death would destroy my mom.

all of the stuff i listed has taken place in a span of 9 years. each year i experienced an extreme traumatic event. I'm only 18. i never got to properly experience my teenage years.

other random stuff i need to get off my chest and that also make me feel like I've been cursed:

i have Premenstrual Dymorphic Disorder (PMDD). I consider it the worst out of all the other disorders i have. two weeks out of every month my body and brain torture me. when i was told at 16 im to young to legally have a hysterectomy (the only known cure for most pmdd patients) and i would have to try almost every medication for pmdd before a doctor would consider it i started sobbing. I'm still trying different medications. The current one isn't working well so far.

i also might have to leave the place I've lived for 9 years for another country within the next 2 due to the fact I'm trans and things have been feeling more unsafe in the US as of late. what's especially difficult (and the cherry on top) is that I'm autistic so even minor changes are REALLY really hard. i also have a lot of friends and a community here. it just seems the major life changes have just been ramping up lately. I've been experiencing psychotic episodes lately due to sheer stress.

basically I'm trying to say that whenever something good finally happens and i can rest for a second it gets taken away from me. i can't remember the last time my body wasn't slightly tense actually

i feel like i can't tell my mom or even my friends I've had for years anything. all this trauma has left me not knowing how to emotionally open up. i feel so isolated even in a room of people i love. I've recently become emotionally and mentally unstable with my personality, morals, and behavior completely shifting in a single second. I feel like i can't trust anyone. I feel out of control.

I feel like i have upset the universe with my existence.

(ps don't ask me how my intestines can tie and then untie themselves i genuinely don't know. that's just what I've been told by everyone that was there. also i hope I'm ok to post this here. if not please let me know and I'll take it down. apologies if I'm not very coherent. i hope you all have a good day💖)",depression

20758,"I’d like to keep this nice and short, but if it ends up longer than I intend this to be, please be patient with me. Also, English is not my first language.

I’m a medical student, also working a part-time job for hours for minimal wage. I have no time for hobbies, and on top of everything, my family is very unsupportive, and I’ve been battling with a chronic stomach illness for a year already with no definitive answers so far from my doctors. I still have a ton of examinations to undergo, ranging from CTs, scans to endoscopies and multiple blood marker tests, and I have to pay all of them out of my pocket since my insurance doesn’t cover them. I’ve been working a lot to support myself, and lately I caught myself crying a lot, feeling hopeless, and most of the time, feeling completely numb, disconnected from reality and in general, feeling nothing. I feel like I’m a complete fuck-up.

Yeah, withdrawals and discontinuation syndromes suck. But discouraging people from taking medication X that his doc prescribed now he's scared to take it is immoral.

You had this experience, fine, doesn't mean he will. I saw a post on someone taking clonazepam for years on 6 mgs a day.

He stupidly cold-turkey'd one day and even months later he had no withdrawals. Other's might have lethal seizures.

It's very annoying to see a question about medication X and then tons of comments practically tell him not to take it because of withdrawals. 

Withdrawals are normal, so are discontinuation syndromes. You must go through it for 1 - 2 weeks, yes, very uncomfortable. I also suffered it. But this is not a reason to discourage someone to take the medication he was prescribed for his illness.

Not to mention, he is not you. He/She might not experience the same things you did.

20549,"Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for a good 10 years now, with the worst dip taking place a year back. Im slowly starting to get better but lately something weird has started happening. 

The worst part of depression for me is the sadness that I cant seem to shake. It’s not the normal kind of sadness, rather the romantic/heartbroken sadness. 
I’ve not been in a relationship for a long time, and I’m not well enough to be in a relationship at the time. 
I still talk to girls like I used to, but in a much more restricted way.
One person recently wrote to me and we started talking (nothing intense or anything).
When that person doesnt answer or say something I could interpret as something negative through mental parkour,
My heart breaks, I get the biggest pit in my stomach and I get completely engulfed in the sorrow. 
This happened the very first day of us talking. 
I am not in love with this person, we dont really know eachother, nothing has happened, i dont even know if what we’re doing has any romantic side to it at all.

Most of the time I can understand why I feel the way I do, even if it’s mostly negative. But this anxiety-ridden pit in my stomach wont go away, and I cant reason with it.

So I guess the TLDR; 
I become unreasonably romantically attatched, after just a few words over text, which leads me to feel constantly heartbroken.

20722,"I guess a little backstory for me: I (18) was diagnosed with depression (and ADHD if that’s at all relevant) a year or two back and have been medicated on and off since…

but no matter if i’m medicated or not I can’t help but WANT to sleep all the time. Like I’m not always that tired, but sometimes i’ll get a very slight wave of drowsiness and take that as an opportunity to just cozy up in my bed and lay down. I don’t go on my phone laying in my bed. I just lay there. sometimes I’ll lay there with my eyes closed for a few minutes.. on and off I’ll suddenly feel a little more awake but be too comfortable to want to get up, or feel so slightly tired that I wanna just lay down and ‘fix it’

But I kind of like it? Like I know that if I tell people I want to sleep all day they’ll often just say it’s depression and that I ‘don’t want to exist’ or something like that.. I want to exist.. I just only ever feel so slightly motivated for 2-3hr at a time. and I live with my mother so i don’t have much real reason to get out and do anything because she seems completely fine with supporting me (which I still often feel bad about still depending on her). And small triumphs like doing my laundry or cleaning my room can’t be it. I’m supposed to be an adult. I’m supposed to have a job. I’m supposed to have any kind of relationship with people.

20065,"both depression and mental exhaustion or burnout share a lot of the same things:

\- no energy to do things

\- bad sleep

\- not in the mood to do things

\- a very bad memory and not able to remember things

\- not being capable of having fun because you feel so tired

\- you want to do things but are just not able to do so cause you feel so crappy

\- getting angry or irritated at everything and everyone

how did you know that you were/are depressed and not just mentally exhausted or burned out?

I learned that a depressed person might still want to do things but feel so tired and don't enjoy the things they wanna do or used to enjoy.

i had some kind of medical form with a lot of questions and the result is that i have a very high score on distress and depression, but depression can cause high distress symptoms and high distress can cause depression symptoms.

Anyone who can share some information?

Ps, they claim i am clinically depressed for a few years now but i don't wanna die (i also don't care if i live or die. If i die then so be it).",depression
20943,"I have no friends at this point due to either my own mistakes or just things not working out. I had a falling out with my family so I'm essentially NC with them, and on top of that I recently moved to an entirely new state. I had to sell a lot of my belongings that helped me cope with my depression, such as my laptop and PS5. 

My partner is a fantastic person and the moments I get to spend with him everyday are a blessing. He has similar issues,  but I insisted he kept his computer since that's his lifeline. On top of that, he has numerous social circles who adore him.

I've been having a terrible depression spout just due to the new location and lack of socializing, and it stings when I'm awake at night sad and alone,  and I hear him talking to one of his many friend groups. They play games, have fun, just hang out. He'll do this all night, and I have to sleep and wake up to him having fun.

I asked him to keep his belongings and I love that he has friends, but I just get so upset that he has things that I just cannot have - a loving family, friends who would never replace him, games he can play - it makes me so irrevocably depressed that I just can't have those things for some reason. I have autism, ADHD and social anxiety and I try to communicate my jealousy to him but at the end of the day, it isn't his problem. I want him to be happy but I'm upset that he can do these things, which is shitty of me to even feel.

How do I get over it? How do you even make friends when you're just a piece of shit person with no good qualities? I'm tired of being so damn lonely. What's the point of doing things if I can't even share them? I love to read and write but I'm not even motivated to do those things because I can't talk about them to anyone.

It got so bad last night I burned myself with a lighter, took some Tylenol PM and just slept despite sleeping all day already.

Growing up  it hurts that your mom and dad argue violently over the phone about their relationship and who doesn’t want to keep me back and forth I would cover my ears and rock even growing up I was very very munched bullied told my mom and nothing would be done even told her as a 10 year old I wanted to unalive… ignored me even told her a lot of time growing up and I didn’t have my dad alot due to him being on drugs and in and out of prison  and  my mom being upset about it losing her soulmate and going to my dad they have a very very rocky relationship and marriage and they could’ve been better off divorced even.  One time she and him went all out on it  changing locks separated even her leaving me with my little sister for weeks to see random men she just met but took each other back my mom has bully me about my weight even called me a hoe a bitch a disappointment and how much she wants me out of her house and everything hurts my feelings even calls my undiagnosed (very much have it ) adhd a retard Thing  a problem and I have adhd and tells my dad about it like I’m. Such a retard…. She even threatened me many times to put me out a girl who’s does everything she ask for went to school getting decent or good degrades first to grad high school soon college and in college to be a teacher … but she wants to put me out and everything and not my 40 year old brother who literally has nothing going for him and has the nerve to call him the better child even though they rarely get into he calls her out her name and she does too I never done that to her no matter how mad Iam ,I don’t know what I did wrong my heart hurts.  I seek attention from the wrong crowd from men from anybody just to be groomed to feel all sweet and happy in my heart and All I wanted is motherly love and a healthy relationship we do then something happens and I’m getting hurt naked called fat she and more  my dad sometimes agree with her and even takes her side it’s rare when he takes my side he’s even worse  at times I have mental breakdowns from them and even cry myself to bed wanting a  loving relationship with them. Even had a few work mothers who I enjoyed it fills a hole in my heart even because of them  they call me the sweetest names and talk to me about my issues than her brushing it off even my dad calling me weak all  because of this I gained age regression and find comfort  from this at late nights or when I’m all very much alone",depression

The effort that is required to start making my life better, and getting better myself, is something that I simply cannot put into it right now. I have tried countless times, and failed every single time. The more succesful attempts at recovering never lasted either, and it's always gotten as bad as things had been before.

Even if I do get better, is it even worth it? I'm constantly suffering right now, and my brain feels like a torture prison, that I'm forever stuck inside of. I could end that pain right now, instead of working hard, and regaining a bit of control over my life...

I’ve been In a very serious relationship for over a year and a half, and it suddenly came to an end when my girlfriend decided we needed a break. My mental health got in the way, I’m an overly possessive and indirectly controlling person and I know I really fucked up. 

I want to fix everything, I’m seeing her soon to hopefully smooth things over and hopefully try again. But I can’t stand the thought of being alone for the rest of my life, I don’t want anyone else in this whole world. I only lived for her. I’m terrified that someone else is already trying to take her. Because I’m nothing, I’ve got no confidence in myself, I spend every waking moment of my life thinking about her.

I want to win her over again, I’ve written down all my thoughts and apologised for the way I acted and I’ve told her the changes I’ve made. She hasn’t seen this note I’ve written yet but I’m just terrified that she won’t let me start again. I’ve bought some flowers for her that are being delivered straight to her. 

If I can’t have her back then I’ve got no reason to be alive, I committed my entire life to her and I ruined it. What else can I do to make her love me again. I can’t stand the pain of not having her in my life. I don’t eat anymore, I don’t leave my bed. I just lay here waiting for the day we meet. And I can’t carry on without her.

20067,"I know it just comes with trauma that I have no idea how to compact, and I feel so behind..

I live at home with my mom because of student loans from a degree I had to drop out of because her credit score wasn't good enough, and neither was mine. I now sit with 80k in student debt and only 20k would be gone if Biden finally wipes away student debt..

My mom right now has been more anxiety inducing than before. I get it, I'm overweight, I have mental health issues, need some sun and a better job, but it doesn't help when she berates and complains about it daily and comparing me to others.

I barely eat as it is, and while she serves unhealthy food as well, she gets mad that I'm not eating healthy and moving like a fucking swan. I'm like 200 lbs full of anxiety, different kinds of odd combinations of grass and veggies in some green smoothies that tastes like eating someone's ass that hasn't showered for 3 years. Still gets mad that I eat unhealthy when she makes it and it's literally all we have.

She gets mad that I don't spend time with her at all and prefer to hang out with my friends that are online. She tells me I look ugly and I should look better in clothes that look ugly on me as it is. 

Literally, she treats me just like my older brother did minus the sexual abuse I endured for 14 fucking years (which ended when I was 26 by leaving to art school and finally having a way to make it end by severing ties with him (well he did it with me)

Being yelled at because I get anxious or depressed isn't a way to help someone unpack trauma nor help them get motivated about doing better.

It's gotten so bad I can't focus on anything very well. I don't even have privacy to go and study to be a data analyst in Coursera because school is really expensive nowadays and i don't have the time to be able to go.

I feel really stuck. 

And I know many people are gonna say it's procrastination and I get it might be, but it stems from an overflowing and ever-changing amounts of anxiety and depression that has never stopped. I can't afford therapy because that shit isn't covered, nor can I drive to one because I don't have a car nor do I have the money to pay for an Uber drive weekly along with whatever fee therapy comes with.bi also never have privacy so I can't do at home therapy. I have so little privacy my mom barges in and tries to talk to me even though I tell her I'm in a literal meeting. But if I try to set boundaries or do things myself I'm called an asshole... It's so much thrown at me I feel like I just freeze and just sit and do nothing because that's better than sitting with her and possibly be yelled and berated at for my weight for the umpth time even though she's heavy and diabetic herself.

20856,"I feel stuck in place. I want to move forward but decisions I've made in the past have not turned out well, so I worry that the next decision will be another failure instead of moving forward. Then depression and loneliness destroy my motivation to do much of anything. Loneliness and the fact that I express love and desire through touch makes my libido rage, but awkwardness and introvert tendencies make it hard to connect. But the longing for connections makes me make bad decisions in my wish for connection and intimacy.  It all feels like too much. If I didn't have work I feel like I would just sleep all the time. Even the things that used to help, playing video games, reading, watching movies and shows bring me less and less joy as time moves on. Sometimes I'm even angry that I was born at all. Not that I've never had happy moments but they get lost in the sea of depression. So, here I float on these waters with no land in sight.",depression

20658,"What's it all about. I can get by ok outside even sitting in a room with friends or family, at college etc.

But once in my room and I spend a lot time there as not very social and introverted.

I end up fapping all the time as it makes me feel good. But it's not healthy or ideal. 

I used to be happy playing video games, movies, tv etc. But not getting into them so much now.

I feel as I'm older not a teenager and at parent house (will be for at least 2 more years due to finances and study) perhaps its not right I'm not sure. Even if I had a flat would it be any different. When I have a gf I don't even care about sex but single I just think about it all time it's weird haha.

Tbh when I'm alone I find I just want to fap and think of sex. Maybe having a gf would help that aspect I don't know? Even still I'm just not losing myself I movies and video games proffering to study etc which is fine but should have fun stuff to.

I make music but can't be bothered that either.

I also notice my hair thinning and think about that all the time which gets me down a lot and makes me feel ageing, maybe a root cause of my depression.

Anyway overall its like I can walk about my house fine but as soon as I go into my bedroom my mood drops so low and my room is nice, open, lots of fun things tv, games, music etc.

Maybe at my age bedroom just for sleeping now? But still it is what is why can't I be happy room.

Maybe I just not got a good balance. Due to my crap hair I stopped going out at night or weekends which was fun and common when younger. I just feel ugly, old and depressed to go out now. 

When I used to go out I found that I was happy home in room for few days as no desire to go out. Then go out and repeat.

Now I never go out so could be issue to? So I feel always in my room, balance was better before.

Also not just my hair but I'm older and lost many friends who have moved on married had kids etc so going out is not really a thing anymore anyway.

I'm so lost right now.",depression

I don’t care about relationships. I’ve never had a crush. I don’t like talking to people. The closer I get to someone the more I want to run away from them. All of my conversations are surface level, just the bare minimum to reach what’s socially acceptable.

I don’t have any hopes or dreams for the future. I don’t have any hobbies. I don’t have any passions or interests. I don’t feel excited. I don’t feel joy doing anything other than sleeping. 

I’ve planned for suicide on three different occasions. The first time I was stopped before I could carry it out. The other two I failed and wound up in the hospital. Each time I said “okay, I’ll go get help. Maybe things will improve. Maybe things will get better.” 

They don’t. How many times am I going to do this? How many times and I going to repeat this, hoping it’ll be different?

Long term depression and anxiety has left me a hollow husk of a living being. I’m either crumbling under anxiety, completely apathetic, or about to snap from irritability.

Though I was homeschooled and clearly have social problems, I am capable of keeping a conversation going. I don't have any friends I really hang out with, and have a total of 3 online friends with whom I interact with regularly. I have not committed suicide due to religious reasons. I have experienced loss of a loved one and have not been able to move on. I am supposed to finish GED this year, but get too frustrated of reading so much and getting answers wrong.

I've gone to therapy, I've picked up hobbies, and I've done all the things they say will cure depression yet here I am lying in bed, having called out of work again. I didn't think I'd ever feel this way again, but I just want to die. I want to disappear. I want to be forgotten about. 

I've gotten rid of all my friends, my girlfriend just thinks I'm sick and I feel like I can't share my deepest feelings with her because of the stress she already goes through, my parents don't speak with me. I feel like if I'm not doing something for others they don't want me...

20902,"im currently in therapy and we’re talking about being more social with friends as well as setting boundaries. my therapist is aware of a friend group i have, about my only close friend group, of 3 guys (im a girl). boys like to roast and they like to be really, really mean. i often question why i’m still friends with them at this point because i can’t talk to them about personal issues, we no longer all have the same interests, i have a career and they don’t so having money/not having money affects us actually doing things such as traveling (which i always want to do, but scared to do alone and they’re my only options)… but really when i think about it i just don’t enjoy their friendship. there’s one “friend” in particular who always brings up my ex even though i’ve asked numerous times to not update me on what he’s doing. i’m currently trying to recover from that emotionally &amp; mentally abusive, toxic relationship. matter of fact, he’s the reason why i spiraled a few weeks ago because he brought up something about without even warning me. 
circling back to the roasting, they will so easily bring up this trauma as a “roast” and something to laugh at, invalidate my mental illness, and make fun of me for attending therapy because i’m “wasting money for someone to tell me i’m normal”. i fucking hate that i can’t seem to let go of their friendship despite how awful i feel about all of them, but i feel like without them i don’t have anyone to do things with or talk to all the time. idk what to do. it’s either be alone and have them in case or just be alone period and obviously that will just continue this cycle of loneliness and dark depression. wtf do i do. ☹️",depression

Currently at university, I’m trying to do well and complete my course but some weeks I just stay in my room wasting my life away, I either feel numb, depressed or have strong emotions which I can’t begin to understand or process. I’ve battled with these feelings since a teenager I’ve had my ups and downs but I’m loosing faith in the world and the way things are.

Some days I want to die but then the next I try improve and feel better but it’s a constant cycle, I get more exhausted every time I have to pull myself away from these feelings.

I used to have some self esteem and socialise and build relationships, now I struggle to connect to people now and just feel awkward. I often analyse social situations and just feel regret.

My thoughts spiral sometimes I get stuck for hours, I have things I enjoy but the world seems cold, everyone feels so distant.

I have never in my entire lifetime heard a woman say they like short men. Maybe I could have but it's almost negligible to how many times I've heard ""tall men are so masculine, protective, dominant"" And stuff like that. The media is filled with tall men being the protagonist and all the women fawning over them. I mean how could someone live with this. I know a lot of people are gonna say, be stoic and shit, but doing that is very hard. I wanna be completely transparent that my hatred for women has also increased because of this.

Now I realize that all I’ve accomplished through this is to prolong my suffering. Every day of my life is pain and misery and nothing else, and it will always be that way.

We get nothing and yet we’re expected to be grateful for a life empty of everything that makes it worth living. So I think I’m done with all of this nonsense. I haven’t planned my way out yet but I think this is where my story is going to end. I can’t imagine a future where I’m happy and I won’t bother trying anymore.",depression

20012,"20M

I feel like im slowly decaying. My mind slips; i cant remember much anymore, i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore; at least not the ones that ive done already (which is just about everything). I have all the desire in the world to get better, but no motivation. I can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. I noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time, and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. It feels like a disease.

My life just feels like im in limbo every day. I wake up, do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week, then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. At night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks, which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. Its nothing horrifying or disturbing, but they really bother me. Its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose.

The thought that really bugs me the most, the reason for making this post in the first place, tells me to push people away. Not really in that exact manner, but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. Everyone is normally completely fine, but not during my episode. It makes me feel like a completely different person. It makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. Its similar for my friends. Im fine with them normally, but during my episodes, they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. But after i go to sleep and wake up, everything is back to normal. I love my girlfriend, and i like my friends. This thought didnt start happening until this month. I never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends, and i always hated being alone, and i still do; which is how i can tell that im getting worse. Im just not me anymore, im a completely different person than the one i used to know.

The other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future, and general sadness questions. Wondering if im ever going to live a stable life, or if im going to feel happy and content ever again, or if i will continue to be a failure forever. I always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually, and i cant feel like this forever, but most times its hard to convince myself. I cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. Im not suicidal, i dont have a desire to stop living, and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. But these episodes make it really difficult to be a living, functioning person.

I need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. I know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally, but im afraid of them.",depression

I’m a 25M who hasn’t had a girlfriend since my early 20s. I just don’t see myself getting better. The depression has consumed me and I feel terrible for my friends and family. Like maybe I am a root of the bad energy in the friend group.

I still live with my mom, I have money saved but I have no clue what to do. My appetite gone again, all the weight and progress I’ve gained from the gym has been lost. And I just have no energy or motivation at the moment. 

I work part time and even at work some days I just feel so unfulfilled with my job. I just feel like a freaking loser. And i’m letting those around me down.

20845,"I am 27 (M). I am married and I have an amazing, loving and supportive wife. However, I am divorced. My ex-wife hurt me pretty bad, but not how most people would think. She had two sons and I happily raised them as my own (#1) and things were great. One day, she made the suggestion that I should get a vasectomy because neither of us wanted more children and we were both completely happy with our lives at that point. She didn't force me too, but I did it. I trusted my wife. I got the procedure (#2). Fast forward, one day, I find my wife in my bed with another man, such decency.

We divorce, I lose everything, as most men do. I lose my wife, I lose my children (that I raised from infancy, but aren't biologically mine, so I have absolutely no rights in the state I live in and I have never seen them since the day she left). 

I get married, I tell my now wife up-front about everything. She loves me anyway. I can't shake the feeling of what I have done to myself. To take it steps further, I work in child welfare. Everyday, I see people who have children and they piss it away. I would give anything for that opportunity. I paid thousands for a reversal and it wasn't successful. I've never been a suicidal man and I've never felt any panic type emotions until all of this hit me in the face.

Everything I have done to myself. I know life isn't over, but I now have to face the reality that I could quite literally die alone... And I am 27. I've tried medicine, I've tried exercise, I've tried counseling, for months. Nothing shakes this feeling of emptiness. I feel like I was set up and robbed, but what was taken was worth much more than money. I don't know who to call, I don't know where to turn.. I'm not even sure if this is the right place to be but.. I know my wife loves me. I just don't love myself anymore. I feel like the stupidest and most naive man to have ever lived. I trusted my wife. 

Most 27 year olds, you know, they do stupid things. I've thought about suicide but not because I don't want to be alive. My parents just think I was stupid for ever making that decision. All I can respond with is, ""Yeah, I was pretty stupid."" And that's it.

I lay in my bed every night with a beautiful woman and I cry myself to sleep because I robbed myself and I robbed her and I can't cope with it.

Can anyone help me?",depression

20517,"What are you meant to do when you hit 40 and realise you've achieved nothing and never will, that you're not special or creative or talented, that the world will not change in the slightest because of you, that fiction is depressing as these characters you love would scorn you for being useless and average and pointless? I feel like as a kid, I used to dream I could do something, make something, but here I am, unable to make anything of worth, doped up on Prozac and working a basic admin job which I could do in my sleep. But I don't know how to be anything more. I don't have a mentor, I don't have support or guidance, I don't think I ever did. I'm so - unfulfilled. I doubt I'm alone. I suspect many people are like this. Which makes it worse, really. Escapism hurts, because all I can imagine is my beloved characters loathing me, but i can't make anything in the real world as I don't know how and I don't have any real talent and absolutely no drive or passion. Sometimes the only thing I think I contributed is that being nearly menopausal, at least I have never and will never breed, so no others will feel like this. I don't want the point of my life to be a negative. I wanted childfreeness to give me the freedom to be worthwhile in my own right, but I just am not. I wanted to be a creator, not a mere consumer. All my friends are successful - some famous, some highly qualified, some just with good jobs and fulfilment - and I am without doubt the group 'loser'. I'm so tired. I'm so jealous, all the time. I want to make something to give to people that they want and like, but I have no audience, nobody who cares or wants anything of me.

I can't even hold to any faith. I can't believe. I hate being atheistic, I hate the lack of meaningful beauty (to me, I'm fully aware of the 'but nature is beautiful!' type arguments but without any - animistic sentience, I guess, it doesn't matter to me) - but I can't do it. I hate the doctrine of 'make your own meaning' - it's illogical - if one's self has no meaning, then one's made-up meaning in turn has no meaning. I used to love loving the gods, but I can't feel them any more. I miss my faith so, so much. And I can't make anything of myself in the 'real' world. The emptiness is so much.",depression

20063,"Hello, all. Thank you for taking the time to listen! I recreantly have been on a weight loss journey and have lost roughly 100 pounds in 3 months. I did this by exercising for a few hours a day and being careful of what I eat or drink. 

These last two weeks though, I have been bingeing and eating like there is no tomorrow. An adventure that is driving me insane and, honestly, depressed. I still work out and such. During the daytime I am happy and on cloud-9; the feeling that anything is possible and the world is my oyster. At night though, I get depressed and always have these cravings for sugary food. Even though I do not want the food, I end up indulging.

The only way to numb the non reluctant pain is through expressive amount of work. At all times. I've had depression for ten years and have the diagnoses of chronic depression. 



Being a remarkable student doesn't fix the pain. It numbs it. If I don't indulge in work then my depression hits. Filling my brain with work excludes me from killing myself. 



The amount of work does at least give me an accommodating future. Being caught up in this misery of perfectionism is ruining me. 



What I fear most is summer vacation. I can't stand vacation. The time where I drive myself nuts on my own. Signing up for lecture after lecture. I really am in misery but I am too numb to cry. 



I am waiting for vacations so that I can work myself to an extent, just over manageable. An extent that makes people worried if they knew. Even though people only see a little glimpse of my sickness, I am very very sick. I am aware, but also so sick that I'll always keep going.",depression

20159,How so most of you deal with your families? As the oldest there’s so much responsibility just thrown on me and it sucks. Our dad bailed on us when we were younger so it’s just my mom. For as long as I could remember my life has been nothing but stressful. I’m 22 currently with the youngest siblings I live with being 19. Im the only one with a job and it’s been driving me into an even further hole. My sister has been such a bitch to me lately and I don’t know why. I barely interact with them cause they just always give me suicidal/murderous thoughts. They always have my blood pressure going through the roof and giving me constant headaches. I try to tell my mom about it but she’s under a stern belief that black people cant be depressed and suicidal. It’s only for “white” people as she claims. I can’t afford therapy atm and I just want to leave but I can’t. Any suggestions on what I should do?,depression
