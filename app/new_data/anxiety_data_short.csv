22154,"So, based on therapy, I read The Drama of the Gifted Child and it blew my mind how many things it described that I used to think were just ‚Äúquirky‚Äù about my parent, and then nailed ways it may have affected my emotions.

I have been experiencing some weird effects, which are feelings of weakness, weird random head pressure that will come and go, and weird scalp sensation that come and go and pressure weird dreams, etc...  Just was wondering if anyone else has experienced these symptoms or other symptoms when taking or going off of Lorazepam..Like I said, I only take it if I feel extremely anxious.  My anxiety has also been really high..Has anyone experienced these symptoms due to anxiety and or effect from Lorazepam/benzos?

21515,"Tl;dr Been following this sub from a diffrent profile. Finally decided to post.  For years ive struggled with what were thought too be temporal lobe seizures. (Severe deja vu, waves of nausea, and it loose the ability to understand verbal communication or speak coherently) these last for 10-15 minutes and occur 3 or 4 times a day. We have tried and tried to catch them on the eeg but are unable to. My neurologist refered me to a psychiatrist who calls them pseudo seizures and insists they are anxiety based and that whether I want to admit it or not i have PTSD from childhood trauma and some military/law enforcment experiences in my 20's. 

I am a father of 4, I am in the process of changing jobs which will require us to move. We are in the process of selling a house, buying a house, changing jobs, relocating to another state. In addition, my wifes emoloyeer refused her request to relocate and she was laid off last week. We homeschool 2 kids and my current job requires travel 45 weeks out of the year. My job is very high stressed. Im in a high executive management position with thousands of direct reports, financial obligations, budget goals, profit goals, plus increasingly difficult daily operational goals. 

Over the last few months my anxiety has become debilitating! Even with my medication (trileptal and seriquil) im to the point were I can be walking down the street and get the image in my head of a car swerving and hitting my on the side walk. This thought gets glued in my head and i am scared to walk down the street. Yesterday I was dozing on the couch and my 5 year old laid their tablet on my chest. The power cord stretched across my neck and i woke screaming with the image stuck in my head of being strangled by a power cord. Its as if I live in red alert. Loud noises, sudden movements, crowded rooms, new unfamiliar settings, traffic...i try my best to avoid it all but the isolation is becoming severe. This is happening more and more frequently. Im honestly scared. 

Ive tried discussing with my wife but she dosnt get it. She is so task oriented that any free time we have is used to discuss, analyze, dissect, reanalyze, plan, replan, budget, etc for all of the major upcoming moves we have. This serves as a constant reminder of how overwhelmed I am. Im drinking to much to sleep and try to temporarily check out.  But its killing me and im ready to give up. Im seriously considering checking myself into a hospital. But i will loose my job and it will throw a wrench into all the plans we have been making for the last year. 

Im hoping that people with similar minds can give suggestions before its to late.",anxiety

21448,"I have been on antidepressants since the age 15. I have severe anxiety that sometimes leads to anxiety attacks. In the past few months‚Ä¶. 1) I hit a deer equaling $4000 worth of damage with a $2000 deductible; 2) I used all my sick days at work; 3) my psychiatrist quit and I wasn‚Äôt able to get my Zoloft or adhd meds filled; 4) an electrical panel in my car stopped working; 5) I paid almost $200 for a rental car while mine was in the shop and I couldn‚Äôt even use it the first day because it wouldn‚Äôt make it up my icy driveway, causing me to be late for work. 

It was that day I decided to go to my usual walk in clinic to see if they could call me in Zoloft because I was having a hard time getting out of bed. See, your body can‚Äôt stay in fight or flight mode indefinitely (which is what anxiety is) so eventually it has to shut down (depression). I get there and they tell me I have to have an appointment. That was apparently the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I began crying and hyperventilating. It was one of my worst panic attacks ever. Part of me was concerned they were going to have me committed. They were able to call in a 30 day supply and made me a follow up appointment. Which was today.

And they remembered my scene. So obviously my erratic behavior is because I‚Äôm a drug addict. I never once had to take a drug test to get my adhd meds with my old psych. This time they asked me to pee in a cup. I have anxiety so of course my first thought was that they thought I was bonkers the other day, but I had nothing to hide so I obliged. When I got home I got a call saying they couldn‚Äôt call in my meds because I tested positive for opiates. Excuse me? That‚Äôs IMPOSSIBLE. They said I would need to bring in a prescription to explain the reason I failed. I said I hadn‚Äôt taken anything, and that I could now care less about my medicine but this needed fixed to clear my name. They said they could send it off to the lab, and I said YES YOU BETTER DO THAT! Yes, I am still being emotional and irrational at this point. Not because of what they are accusing me but because my seratonin and dopamine receptors DO NOT WORK like they should‚Ä¶which is the reason I was going there for help. Instead, they decide to bring a devastating accusation against a person with emotional dysregulation (ADHD) and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder). It is negligence. What if this behavior caused a person to harm themselves? Do no harm. The way in which they handled this was very harmful. Almost as if they have no training on how to handle delicate individual (which medical personnel should). 

I did some research and guess what‚Ä¶.poppy seeds! I just made a batch of lemon poppy muffins the day before yesterday. Surely the lab will be able to differentiate between poppy seeds and an actual drug, right??? It‚Äôs a small town and I KNOW they will break patient confidentiality because I‚Äôm a teacher‚Ä¶I just know it‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had soMe of their kids in class. Of course they will tell other parents. 

I‚Äôm done with my ADHD meds‚Ä¶I refuse to jump through these hoops anymore. And to be treated like a criminal. I‚Äôm erratic yes, but not because of drugs. I‚Äôm falling apart right now.",anxiety

21471,"

Hello! I had a really bad insomnia last February which made me sleep every other day for a week. My sleep has been okay since my family doctor presrcibed me Hydroxyzine 10mg for sleep. Although I've been sleeping well, I now have this feat surrounding sleep. Everyday all I think about is sleep, which makes me anxious and unproductive all day. It made me lose interest on the things i used to enjoy. Even before the insomnia, I was really anxious about many things, especially my health. Do you guys think SSRIs will help me? Or i should go with therapy? Thank you!",anxiety

3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving, i hate taking a shower, i hate exercising. You name it, if i makes me hot, i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.

Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.

However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear, and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.

Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.

Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.

At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. 

It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.

TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens

TLDR 2: If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you",anxiety

21731,"I have had severe panic attacks for about 3 years now, and just mental anxiety (no physical symptoms) for my whole life probably. It has morphed into health anxiety and being constantly worried that I have a tumor or heart attack or stroke which is an awful way to live.

21468,"Before anyone reads, I'm in the middle of an anxiety attack so everything in this post is everywhere and some words may be misspelled.

I think I know why too because the last time it happened I ate food that caused me to have a previous anxiety attack.

After I finish this I'm going to get some sleep so I will read any comments and make the necessary corrections to this post in the morning.

So anyway. I went across the street from work today to get some food from this ""chicken spot"" called Kennedy Chicken, I live in NYC, they're on every corner.

ALL of their food is super duper unhealthy. It's all deep fried foods. Chicken and mozzarella sticks is what I ate. They even gave me spoiled marinara sauce which I didn't eat because I noticed as soon as I opened the sauce container, the air pressure made the sauce fly everywhere on my hands and there were bubbles in it. I smelled it and it had an obvious spoiled smell to it like fermented tomatoes. üòñ I'm never eating from there again. EVER! And honestly I don't know how they're even still open.

It has been a while since I ate their food until today.

I've been trying to eat healthier foods. Even if I have to order out on days I don't pack my lunch at home, I choose a healthier option.

OR!!.. or..

It could be that I haven't been getting enough sleep since Monday. And everytime I feel the palpitations coming on, I always go to sleep and the next morning I feel better.

I've been to the ER multiple times for palpitations and they tell me it's due to stress and not enough sleep.

I work a full time job and I used up all my pto so it's difficult for me to take a day or two off for myself.

*figuratively rips hair out*

I hate working full time and I think I'm about to make a big sacrifice and go part time. Or maybe I just need to ride it out... I have so many financial issues right now that I can't do this anymore.

I want to move back home with my family.. but I don't have a car... I don't have money.... I need to buy at least a month's worth of food for 1 person (me) so I don't have to order out.

I don't have any idea how I've come this far and haven't ended up homeless.

At this point I'm rambling and I need a hug... but these are things I'm dealing with at the moment.

That food honestly tasted horrible though. üòï I'm betting on my palpitations being caused by both lack of sleep and the fast food though.

I wish there was a way to get my rent lowered so that I can afford to pay all my bills properly... I might talk to my roommate about it and see what she says.

Okay.. if I have anything else left to talk about I'll make another post.

Thank you to anyone who decides to read this craziness!",anxiety

My relationship with my literature teacher is good, but i dont want her to start thinking that im doing this on purpose. im also missing chemistry lessons and im not the best at chemistry, so i feel like im just gonna get worse at it.

I'm taking my O-levels this year which is a national exam and i hate how this is happening. I need to focus on my studies but im finding it so hard to do that.

21882,"After been diagnosed a year ago with diabetes, this has took my energy trying to fix it, and thanks to the medication on max dose and diet changes, this seems to now be working.

Next, I want to fix my anxiety, which got worse in last years, due to a few things, like the diabetes, lock-downs, and struggles with such .

My brain seems over-active, like if I see someone pass next to my front window, it will make me flinch. If doorbell goes it can do that.

Would you say I have General anxiety?

\- My eyes look ugly and intense when I am anxious, and I hate eye contact when like this.

\- Haven't been able to orgasm for many years due to constantly rushing my thoughts.

\- Struggle with eye contact when anxiety is high or confidence is low.

\- Find it hard to show natural emotions, like smile etc. It's faked.

\- I am use to routines.

I want to overcome the above naturally. I do exercise and have gone out on walks each week either by myself or with parents / family. I try various natural supplements that might just help. The latest I am trying is lithium.

What helped you, do you have the above symptoms?

21315,"Most people are mentally and emotionally sane, relatively at least. They might claim that the worry is all in your head, not understanding that your corporeal experience strongly suggests otherwise. They might tell you to think positive, because they don't have an inner voice that constantly gets drowned out by a huge stadium packed with negative objectors. They might take it rather personally when socializing is the very least thing you want to do, they could never imagine that them yapping on about their normal life drains your already depleted life-energy. Some of them might start all kinds of shit with you because they see you as a weak and opportune victim to unload their own shit towards, never realizing they're the real cowards.

Some of them might truly want to help you out and tell you get therapy asap, then you might see some random bureaucrat person completely devoid of empathy struggling to stay awake while you pour you heart of desperately looking for some kind of assistance. Assistance that usually comes in form of dubious drugs that only work at a hefty price by the way So they advice you to go see some private expensive experts, unaware of the fact that your wallets suffers with you. They like to imply that you just chill the f out and relax. Because they don't have that intrusive, horrible, horrible, horrible, encompassing, joy-devouring, soul-obliterating, sucking, painful, torturous, uneasy pit of dread stuck right in their stomach with racing thoughts to boot. Perhaps they'll make sly remarks on how you need to just grow up, after all, they don't know how's it's like to think like an adult while emotionally reacting like a little fragile child scared to death.

They might say go the gym or be physically active and get some endorphins running. To be fair, is actually solid advice if you can muster the strength to go there. Off course they have their problems too, the difference however is that your problem is you and how that you contaminate every aspect of your life. The point is, according to some of 'them' you're just a loser, useless, lazy, afraid, a waste of space, a failure with nothing to show for in life. They are so much better than you and intentionally or not they make you buy their version of you.

However. It's just opinions from judgemental people at the end of the day. I don't want to you to waste any energy on harboring any resentment, envy or anger towards anybody, they just don't understand. How could they know the truth. Perhaps even you don't the truth about yourself, so I'm going to say it, just in case.

You simply being here and keeping on makes you a tough as nails. A warrior that fights hordes of demons every day. Bravery is defined by the will to face fear, you have fear stuffed in your face all the time. You may suffer endless anxiety, but you as a matter of fact are courageous by the definition of the word. Doing your best to just keep going, that's it. It's not some lofty motivational speech, just a cold fact.

It may not help you any bit to read this, but I for one will not let it be unsaid. Anxiety is bad enough in itself, so rather than feeling shame in addition you have earned the right to have pride in yourself. My intention is for you to keep that in mind on your darkest days, because I know very well what it's like to suffer anxiety while having your character measured by factors out of your control.",anxiety

But I'm a mom, I have an almost 5 year old and my husband is military so he's gone sometimes. When he's gone my son likes to act up, doesn't want to listen at all. I'm working on it with him, I'm trying to be productive. My anxiety poses a pretty big difficulty as it turns into pretty bad irritability and aggression when I'm dealing with frustrating situations. The only way I've found to help (which it actually doesnt) is to take on a bland monotonous tone. I'm struggling to find other ways to communicate with him so that we're both calm and hopefully things can get resolved peacefully. I just feel so bad when it ends up being too much and I snap at him.",anxiety

21688,"in the recent few years i've very well acknowledged that i am a pretty anxious person and i kinda got used to it. but something that still bothers me is my separation anxiety and the constant fear of being abandoned by my friends. i don't know how to go about it, especially now that i have a best friend to whom i can't talk all the time, whenever i want or need to. they seem to be more of the avoidant style. i find it very difficult to go through my day if whenever i think of them and talking to them, i have to stop myself and 'give them space.' i don't mean this in a selfish way, naturally i am a pretty understanding person. i try to control my 'urges' for contact, which i crave a lot, but it's been getting harder as the days go by. most of the time i don't even have something important to say, it's just my thoughts and things i mention throughout the day, but i feel blue when i remember that they do not 'prefer' texting everyday because that is something that i really like, want and need. i try my best to respect their boundaries and i am the one to 'adapt' to their needs for space. just recently i started wondering whether it is okay that i bring this up as a boundary and a need of mine. i feel like i've often been the one to change for them and it's been getting to me lately. i don't mean any harm to my bestie and we don't have any other 'unsolvable' problem except for this one. is it okay to text them? is it selfish? i get a lot of thoughts and i address them as anxiety but it doesn't get any easier even when i am fully aware of that. i just wish to put an end to this. it has been affecting my mood lately, i check the messages app hundreds of times only to see no texts from them. i get anxious waiting for a reply and even more anxious when i first think of something to say. it just pops into my mind and i happily open the app but as soon as i start typing i remember the situation and feel guilty about texting them. but then again, i feel very empty if i don't. how do i go about this?",anxiety

I have not seen any bats near me and while the doctors told me to calm down, I simply cannot. Today my throat started hurting but I genuinely cannot tell if I am only imagining that.

Basically the way I'm looking to another person (I try to picture myself how I might be looking and whether it's not wierd). Sometimes I record myself with a phone to see what's the oddity with my behaviour.

The reason this has developed is because from class 5-6 I realised there was something wrong... People would keep a stare once they got a glance of me. I realise, in retrospect, that's because I looked like a girl even though I'm a boy. Perhaps some hormones got messed up and I got some feminine features like long eye lashes, girly lips, girl type face, curved hip, short height.

22041," I think my GAD is so severe it now has a physiological source where my brain chemistry is messed up. My cortisol or serotonin levels throughout the day decide how I feel. DAE see patterns in their anxiety symptoms like this? 

**Mornings**: Wake up feeling shaky and short of breath, takes 30min of scrolling on my phone to get the motivation to get up. 

**Afternoon**: Tension builds up and I feel stiff and uncomfortable for no reason. Or have an adrenaline dump around this time

**Early Evening**: Can be 50-50. Either I feel fine or symptoms start up again and last for a bit

**Late evening**: Right at around 11pm or so some chemical switch goes off in my body and 80% of my issues vanish. It gets easier to breathe, my Heart slows down, and my brain fog lifts. Start feeling much happier too and its very obvious the constant subconscious anxiety has lifted. I have always been a night owl and even before my panic disorder I had weird spurts of energy and motivation in the late evening which made me a productivity machine in the AM. 

**Sleep**: I can sleep relatively ok but if something startles me and wakes me up I have a full on panic attack. I get at least 7h of sleep daily.

The only time I feel like I can truly enjoy the company of other people and not feel like my flight or flight is x100 is when I take a low dose opiate or drink alcohol. 

I stopped doing all of it for two years thinking that I might get better if I don‚Äôt use any substances, but it just spiraled into extreme anxiety and depression since I didn‚Äôt get any breaks from it.

22021,"Recently prescribed klonopin for general anxiety/social anxiety and panic disorder.  Random facts about how my anxiety- I don‚Äôt frequently have panic attacks (couple times a year) but have pretty severe anxiety everyday, from social anxiety to over thinking everything in my life to the point of ruining my day. Also experience nausea before any social setting/event no matter how small, every single time. I also have car anxiety where I do not want to drive and am terrified when I ride with others. 

Been on SSRIS for years, they never work. And when I say don‚Äôt work I mean I couldn‚Äôt tell you if I was taking a tik tac or my medicine, I genuinely wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. Been on lexapro, buspar, Wellbutrin and maybe a few others. My psychiatrist finally decided anxiety is the root, not depression so I don‚Äôt need a ssri. 

I‚Äôm prescribed .5 a day, half or the whole thing twice a day. Took half of .5 for the first month and tbh I didn‚Äôt notice anything. Doctor told me maybe I need to take the full .5 twice a day, so I‚Äôve been doing that and still don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs doing much. Am I immune to medications lol??? I still have anxious thoughts and feelings, I‚Äôll say though maybe the feeling of nausea before social settings has gone away but other than that I feel like my anxiety is still very present ): 

Side note, very very far fetched side note, a thought that I‚Äôve had is maybe, just maybe, ADHD is causing my anxiety? And this is why these medications aren‚Äôt working? I‚Äôve read adhd can cause anxiety disorders.

21989,"My bf is going out with some friends tonight and I was too scared to ask if I could come along. Normally I would but recently he said he wanted some space so it doesn‚Äôt feel right asking him if I can tag along places anymore. He‚Äôll always say yes just to be nice. 

Then my friends call asking if we want to hang out with them and I‚Äôm like bf is already going out. At this point I freak out. Urgent social interaction and I would have to ask bf for a ride. No I don‚Äôt want to bother him. 

I feel stupid that I wanted to go out so bad. But when I was offered another chance to go out I declined because I was too scared of everything. 

I was too scared to ask to go with him

I was to scared to ask for a ride 

I was too scared to go to an unplanned social event

Tomorrow I have a planned social event and now I feel so insecure. It just feels like a cycle. Why can‚Äôt I just do these things?

EDIT: next day and I found out he got a ride for once since he‚Äôs always DD so I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a ride anyway. 

If I had asked for a ride I think it would have been worse because he would have felt pressured to drive me which again would not be great since he asked for space a while back. 

I was feeling like the call was a sign to go out and I didn‚Äôt. So I was feeling down on myself for choosing to miss out. But now that I know I probably could not have gotten a ride anyway somehow I feel better lmao

21558,"I am seriously regretting my decision to go to grad school- I thought I was prepared for it, but I'm wasn't. I was an academically strong student in my undergraduate program and went straight to grad school after because I really enjoy academia. I found my education to be so fulfilling- but now the spark is completely lost.

Ever since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled, but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas- I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days- because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me, thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right now,

And I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety, but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.

I've barely submit any assignments- I keep trying to get them done. I tell myself that today is going to be the day I tackle even just one small thing, but this horrible feeling inside my chest and stomach just paralyzes me from being able to get anything done. I tell myself in 5 minutes I'll get up, it turns into 30 minutes, to 5 hours- then the next thing I know I've exhausted myself from just thinking about what I have to do &amp; I decide that I will try again tomorrow. Each time I try again, I fail.

I wish there was a way others could see how much effort I am putting in- even brushing my teeth and taking a shower are demanding tasks. Eating isn't even enjoyable &amp; food doesn't taste appealing to me- I nearly gag with every bite trying to feed myself.

I wish I didn't have to feel like this. I want to enjoy school and pursue my passions. I was so proud of how far I've come, only to let is all crash and burn now.",anxiety

idk one part of me is saying how it would be easier to just not get help and i can get myself out if it since i‚Äôve done it before but another part is telling me to go to therapy. i‚Äôm only 15 so this is all new and freaking me out. everything just feel so different and weird and scary. sometimes i wish i could just go back a few years. it‚Äôs crazy how bad it got jsut over the course of a few months. i feel like it‚Äôs my fault.

21708,"If I thought I managed my anxiety poorly before, oh boy. This last month has been easily the worst in terms of anxiety I've ever experienced. 
My first born is due in two months. Farming season is about to start. Constantly awake until 3-4 AM reeling about the real possibility of financial ruin due to the costs of having a child and the current state of the agricultural industry. The thought of changing careers only amplifies my anxiety x1000. That's the worst part, being unable to sleep. Sometimes I'll start to go asleep and the slightest noise will wake me up, or I'll just wake up in a full blown panic. I've been spending all day either being a nervous wreck and if I'm not outwardly nervous, my body is still showing physical symptoms of it. Almost like it's subconscious. Sometimes I feel like the anxiety itself is scarier than the situation I worry myself sick over. My other new trigger is every little ache, pain or cough I get I spend the entire day spiraling down a hole thinking I'm obviously dying and I won't be there to see my daughter's first steps and the farm that's been in my family for 5 generations will be sold because nobody will be there to take care of it. 
I hate the physical symptoms the most. The fast heartbeat, constantly being on edge, body and headaches. It's like even if I think I'm getting a rope around my anxiety, it's still there in my subconscious wreaking havok on me. 
I'm sorry if this was convoluted or hard to follow. I just don't have many people I can talk to, and if I can, they have a hard time understanding just how hard this affliction makes things. These things I'm worried about are valid, certainly, anybody who isn't nervous about having a kid isn't in their right mind I suppose, but having a generalized anxiety disorder coupled with panic attacks in the first place just makes it hell on earth and makes you not only question your own abilities but also question your own sanity at times.",anxiety

21893,"due to mental health i've been slightly struggling with uni studies lately. part of why i'm mentally not doing well is because i've grown up with a rather abusive father and one of the things that he's really forced on me has been to do well in studies, like that's just something that's been going on since i started school

so this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home. it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it. the part that causes this isn't that 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll struggle even more with uni' but 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll en up in trouble by my dad'

ultimately i know it's always gonna be 'study for your own sake, not anyone else's' but after growing up with a father that's so abusive in so many ways, it's hard to not make that association and just break out until i can't even focus on studying

so my question is, making that association or not, does anyone have any advice on how i at the very least can calm down or put myself at ease when this happens while studying?",anxiety

21913,"Hello! I'm a gym newbie here, and I've been *really* struggling with going to the gym. 
I have no excuses anymore. I've been telling myself that once I move closer to a gym, once I get a good daily routine in, once I get a job that starts later, so on and so forth... well the stars aligned and I got a gym membership! No more excuses.

Except I've got some sort of gymphobia. I have always felt this way, even went a couple times as a teenager with my dad. I was freaked out then, too.

I went once with my boyfriend right after I got the membership and I wanted to cry the ENTIRE TIME. I was SO self-conscious, to the point it affected my movements. I wasn't focusing on lifting, I was focusing on being quiet, who could see me, how light my weights were, etc. I stared at the clock, couldn't talk louder than a whisper, clung to his side... It was a massive relief to leave and I subconsciously let out a huge sigh the minute the door shut behind us.

Tried going just to treadmill the other day, walked in and went straight to the bathroom because I was so ANXIOUS! There was only one treadmill being used but I was so worried he'd see me trying to figure it out. I got so shakey and almost started crying again so I left the bathroom and went straight home. 

I know for the sake of my mental health I need to overcome this, even if I find out the gym just isn't for me. This is absolutely my anxiety, particularly social anxiety and body dysphoria. What makes me anxious -

- being near other people working out (?!?!)

- seeing my reflection in the mirror

- using light weights (THEY ARE ALL LIGHT so I am just constantly anxious lmao)

- how long it takes me to set up/figure out a machine

- maybe someone else needs what I have and they are annoyed with me

- someone else using what I want and not know what to sub

- anyone talking to me in any capacity lmao

- my form (I'm new so logically I know it'll be incorrect but other people may judge me)

I'm tempted to shell out money for a personal trainer and a therapist. I'm sick of my anxiety and my body as it is, but I wanted to hear yalls advice.

Since this has been causing me so much anxiety forever, and it directly relates to my body dysphoria and anxiety, I feel like overcoming this is going to be a HUGE breakthrough for my mental health. I'd really appreciate your insight.Thank you!",anxiety

21273,"I'm a 27 year old female. I've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. 

I feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. So much so that it drives me to have small OCD traits. Something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before I leave the house. Over and over......and over again. It's weird. 
 
I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene. I'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. To the point of frustration where I just lose it and cry into a panic. 

I dont even know where to start to solve this. I feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. I'm good at playing it off. I'm good at putting on a show because I've always thought I could handle it- lots of people I know feel the same. But it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things I'm doing or too afraid to even try to do.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

I just feel like if I dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then I wont have a fulfilling one. I'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, I'll stick to my same safe routine, and I'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily.

21909,"
So i have been suffering from awful derealization/depersonalisation, anxiety, ocd, and panic attacks for a couple of years now but it‚Äôs always come and gone. Ever since last year after going through a traumatic event it‚Äôs shifted my entire life to now only being able to focus on my anxiety. there are days that i get better and days where i have bad flair ups. I actively go to therapy and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist and nutritionist to see if i could figure out how to solve all these issues especially the derealization as it causes me to feel so out of it and almost high 24/7 as it has been prevalent for the last year especially now. I have been prescribed zoloft before but I had the absolute worst adverse reaction to it and has made me terrified to start any ssris. Recently my psychiatrist had prescribed me prozac but my therapist and nutritionist advise me against it as they do not think that my case is that severe. Where I am currently having an issue with is the fact that my biggest fear/ocd trigger is not feeling normal such as the fear of weed and I typically stay away from alcohol as I do not like how i feel when I drink. I am so scared to start meds or even vitamins that contain magnesium because I am so afraid of the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling or derealization feeling but now don‚Äôt know where to go from here. If anyone has advice on how to get over this substance ocd I would greatly appreciate it.",anxiety

I‚Äôve started a new job about 2 weeks ago, it‚Äôs a higher paying customer care job for an insurance company. I was in retail for 5 years and incredibly comfortable in my position.

21788,"I'm currently playing a video game, but long story short, my question is: Although it's unreasonable and extremely unlikely I'm worried that my account is going to be deleted and it's a 100+ hour game. So, I can either just cut my losses (Only 5 hours in) and start a new account, giving in to the anxious thoughts and discomfort. Or keep going feeling bad playing this account I'm currently playing, but could maybe get over at some point? But my basic question is, to get over anxiety do I have to push through it when it's really hard? Or let my self off sometimes?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm had gaming anxiety for about a year and a half, it's really affecting my enjoyment with them, I always feel that my gameplay experience is  being tarnished in some way, example: Feeling that I'm wasting it feeling anxious, The game is going to bug out on me causing me to have to restart etc.

21294,"Hello, I am new to this community, but I wanted some help. 

I‚Äôll start with some context. I‚Äôve always been a person that throws up and a lot of the time it was when I was nervous. This past year tho it has gotten much worse, with a time where I even went to the hospital because I hadn‚Äôt eaten in like 2 days and I felt so physically exhausted and dehydrated. At first I thought it was from weed and something called CHS, but quitting weed didn‚Äôt really make a difference. I also have delt with this vommiting in highschool before I would go to a party I would get so nervous I would puke. And that was before I ever touched weed.

This led me to go to a gastro doctor who said he did not think it was weed related and instead some inflammation in intestines. I‚Äôve been on meds for that for 3 months but it was getting better and I really started to take my anxiety seriously  so I went to my doctor and they prescribed me an SSRI. I also will start therapy in a few weeks here. For the past month (after about 1.5 month on SSRI) I have been doing better. I hadn‚Äôt thrown up for a month, but these past 2 nights I have had very panic attack like feelings and tonight even pushed me to the point where I had to get up from being comforted by my girlfriend to throw up. And I always feel awful about it and like it‚Äôs going to just keep happening and I think I get stuck in that cycle.

Does anyone have any tips/advice on dealing with this before my therapy appointment I thought I was doing so good but now I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm slipping back.",anxiety

21369,"Monday I have a panic attack and was diagnosed with GAD. 

I'm only 18 years old and I do stress and I have had anxiety before but not that I've had a full on panic attack I feel like it's taking over my everyday things.

Last night I had one and this morning when I woke up I almost had one but I managed through it.

So far I've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

I went to eat at a restaurant and right when I walked it I got panicky and couldn't eat my food because I couldn't hold it down and I had to swallow the 2 bites I did take WITH WATER.

I know this is temporary and I plan to work out and get a therapist and MAYBE take meds but is there anything I can remember to know for next time?

It hasn't been a full week and I've had 2 panic attack and almost another.

I'm anxious about being anxious cause that will trigger a possible attack

Panic attacks make it feel like I'm having a heart attack or anything life threating.

I should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

My hands shake a little and I still have a fast heart beat even when I don't feel panicky. It also feels like a pit in my stomach is waiting for a thought to pop up for me to panic.

When waking up today I panicked and walking it off reminded me of Monday when I walking and had the panic attack.

22029,"Hi all,

30/m/New York

This post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing. 
Might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who has/is going through anything similar. 

I have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently.

4 months ago I had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack. The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. 

A couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work, EKG, echo etc. All results came back fine, as expected, except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse (53 most of the time) and the chest tightness remained. 

Over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent (twice a week) and my chest tightness began to disappear.

I managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that I‚Äôm not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. 

I had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didn‚Äôt find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.

More recently, my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. 
I have been feeling heart palpitations a lot, or more accurately, my heart skipping beats.
I began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point, causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. 

Now I‚Äôm obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.
 
I have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and won‚Äôt get the results back for another 10 days or so. 

And this is where I am at‚Ä¶
Frequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me, give me a stroke or make me faint.

Anyone else gone through this? 

Thanks!",anxiety

so it all started in december 2022 when i had a full blown panic attack that was then followed by an intense fear of d3ath and 30+ physical symptoms that didn't turn out to be terminal illnesses like i expected.. all of these weird symptoms subsided except for my sore/mucusy throat thats followed by a burning feeling sometimes..my throat feels so tight most of the time, makes a growling noise, is full of mucus and i tend to cough..

here are the things doctors have told me:

1- first doctor told me its nothing but a simple sore throat and i was prescribed hot drinks and over the counter flu meds (result: nothing)

2- told me i have GERD/acid reflux and i was prescribed Gaviscon and a few other meds related to this matter (result: felt a lil better but not that better) 

3- third doctor did a culture test on my throat and figured i have  streptococcus bacteria residing and chillin in my throat , i was perscribed KLACID 500MG for 10 days and i felt somewhat better but then my throat got bad again

4- fourth and final doctor said its a simple sore throat and prescribed me hot drinks as well..

22129,"i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine about work settings because i will be having an internship soon. we talked about standard work things and tips, but then it lead to talking about my anxiety.

i asked, ""if i'm unable to speak because of anxiety, how do i communicate that to them?"" 'them' being my coworkers. for extra context, i think this is a common thing but just in case, my throat closes up to a degree that it becomes hard to and painful to breathe or speak. obviously i need to breathe, so i've learned to tough through it, and even so i was able to get an appointment with someone who may be able to help this issue. as for speaking, that can be even more painful than breathing, so i usually try to tap my throat with my finger and hold up one finger with the other hand to try to communicate that i need a minute and i can't breathe/speak.

i was worried that may not be enough, and i had previously told my friend about my issues. i figured he'd be the right guy to ask, especially since he's training to become a therapist. i guessed he may have some ideas i haven't thought about yet

he told me to tell my coworkers i need a minute to think and to maybe say it directly. i asked him, ""if i can't talk, how do i say it to them directly?"" i'm bad with conveying tone, partially because i'm autistic, so i can see in hindsight that it may have come off wrong.

he asked me if i was just going to leave or stay quiet without telling them what was going on, and he also said that the situation would just become worse. i was starting to get a bit upset and i said that i knew that. *then he told me to learn how to force myself to say it.*

that's where i became really upset. i have no idea if this was justified or not, all i know is how much it hurt. i tired my best to remind him of some of my tics, and how if i'm stressed enough to be unable to speak, forcing myself would DEFINATELY make the situation worse. i told him about how there's been times where i've gotten overwhelmed and anxious, which led to me accidently hitting someone rarely or most commonly myself. sometimes i'll have really bad ones which make me yell, fling my arm beside my head, or slam a fist down on a table.

i then apologized. he then told me that it's unfair, but i have to vocalize that kind of thing. i worked some things out with another close friend of mine, and we both agreed that i should maybe carry around some laminated cards on a ring with common words and sayings to help me communicate. we also talked about telling my coworkers and employers beforehand about my issues, and how i need a few minutes to myself to calm down.

i tried messaging the friend from before, saying that i wanted to talk. i apologized for getting upset and explained that i was hurt by what he said and that i was hoping we can talk about it all. i apologized again. i've seen he's read the message, but he hasn't responded. i'm a bit worried, but trying to be patient with out differing time zones.

should i force myself to talk when i am unable to, especially with some of my issues? i want to believe i'm not at fault, but i feel horrible about getting upset and i'm wondering if he's right and i should just try to suck it up.

**edit:** i also worry that i may have overreacted and blown up over something unimportant. it's just so infuriating and hurtful because i've been told all my life to force myself to do things and to just toughen up and deal with it. i've been called overly emotional and at this point any slight indication someone thinks that way kind of sets me off. i'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, i struggle putting these things into words.",anxiety

21255,"Hi everyone, I've had anxiety for the last 6 months or so in varying levels. From January I was in a decent headspace with it but the last three weeks it's got worse and then the last four days or so it's gone off a cliff. 

It's all I think about all day long, I had panic attacks on Monday and Wednesday and my heart is racing all day. Where before I'd wake up rested now I wake up with my heart racing and frequently my muscles are spasming which is scary. The thought of doing normal stuff feels impossible and I can't shake this feeling I can't get better than this ever again. 

I spoke to my doctor on Thursday and he prescribed propranolol which I took yesterday for the first time which helped with the body stuff but my mind was still racing.

22093,"A few years back I decided to change my horrible diet and gain weight. I didn‚Äôt realise if at the time but my diet was so bad. I once went a whole day with just eating a single yoghurt and hadn‚Äôt realised how BAD that was. Well, last year‚Ä¶or the year before? I made an effort to force myself to eat and increase my appetite. It worked. I‚Äôve gained weight and I‚Äôm happy. Well, I could be happier by gaining more weight but I have a fast metabolism so I‚Äôm ‚Äòcomfortable‚Äô with my weight. 

Anyways, last week I got a bug that has now lowered my appetite and I‚Äôve barely eaten anything since then. I‚Äôve now become suddenly conscious that my appetite has gone again and I need to train my stomach to eat more yet again. It‚Äôs gonna take me a few days or a week but I know I can do it.

21894,"I'll add a little background first, im a 35 year old male and have never had any diagnosed conditions or health problems in general. I have always been extremely shy, social + health anxiety, low confidence, never had a girlfriend, no friends since I moved to a different part of the country when I was about 22. Over time I think I have been able to numb it down, creating explanations and reasonings in my mind, and used video games as an escape. For the last 10 years or so, my life have been:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Wake up and eat breakfast

\- Go to work

\- Come home and shower

\- Make and eat dinner

\- Some kind of workout

\- Sit at computer

\- Sleep and repeat

\- Every other weekend I visit my mom, who I spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herself

&amp;#x200B;

But a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety, realizing what my life have been these last 10 years. I feel like I have wasted so much time, especially on the weekends where I was at home doing nothing, instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive. I got thoughts about existential dread, death and what our purpose really is. I got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her, and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me, understands me and that I can be myself with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an alcoholic over 10 years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next - now the video games do nothing for me, I can't ""escape"" and I'm lost for purpose. My appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing, especially when I try to sleep, which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that I can't stop. I keep thinking ""Am I sick? Am I going insane? Do I have a brain tumor?"" and many more thoughts of that kind. I also get this weird feeling somethimes of being ""disconnected"" or ""dissociated"" to the world. I become hyper-aware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird. In this state, I feel like im ""acting"" like myself, when I'm with others - like I'm something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a 3rd person view. Has anyone else experienced this or gone though something similar?

* It is hit or miss, but if I have a presentation or in front of people, get real nervous.  Remember bombing for one performance where I just stood there... one time.
* Get nervous around attractive people for some reason.  Yea.

21673,"Hello everyone I'm a 20 year old Caucasian male. 5""9 155lbs. I don't smoke, i don't drink alcohol nor use any drugs. 

So it's been almost 1.5 years that I've developed some strange symptoms, that have really deteriorated my life.

They basically started after i caught covid (i was vaccined prior with the j&amp;j vaccine). Since then, i get heart pains all the time. They happen multiple times a day and usually last a few minutes before they go away. I've been to 2 different cardiologists who ran an EKG and echo and said that everything was fine. I also had a  48 hour Holter monitor that showed some pvc's (200/a day),but docs weren't concerned at all. 

Also after covid my WBC are basically running around the 11-13k range (before that CBC's would come back fine). They were fine before i got infected, but it's been almost 1.5 year that they won't go down. My lymphocytes are also high (45-50) and neutrophils low 35-40). Everything else comes back completely fine. I went to a hematologist and he run some tests for malignancies(leukemia) but they came back negative. 

One of the worst symptoms also is the spasms I've been getting all over my body. They can happen literally anywhere and they always last a few seconds before they go away. I've searched a lot about them and i guess it's most likely BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). But it never stops. I think my nerve system has been permanently damaged. 

Lastly i get random aches in my stomach and usually at the upper left abdominal region. I've had an abdominal echo and it was fine. But i get random shooting pains along with painful gasses. These are the symptoms I've been dealing with the past 1.5 year. They're all so random and I can't connect them somehow. High WBC usually mean infection, so I'm guessing that an autoimmune disease might have been triggered?

I've also found a lump in my arm. It's been there for 1.5 year as well, i showed it to my gp and he said that it's a lipoma, but it's still there. It hasn't grown but it hurts sometimes. Things like sarcoma drive my mind crazy. It feels like my body is constantly trying to kill me. 

The whole thing is causing me so much anxiety and stress. I thought that things would get better with time, but no, nothing has changed and it's been so long. I'm only 20 years old and I'm afraid that I'm gonna drop dead by a heart attack or cancer. I used to be an athlete but i stopped after all these, because i became afraid. I honestly can't live like this anymore. I've visited more than 5 doctors and nobody has a clue. Any ideas?",anxiety

So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs this voice in the back of my head calling me an idiot for spending so much money on video games when I could be saving it for emergencies. It‚Äôs not just with big purchases either, I still get this feeling whenever I buy a $10 lunch too. 

I think this whole thing started when I was around 5. I was at the store with my parents and I wanted to buy a toy, but my mom said something about how we didn‚Äôt have the money for toys. I, being the stupid kid that I was, interpreted this as ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a lot of money‚Äù and that the family was one bad financial decision away from poverty. Of course this was not the case but that didn‚Äôt stop me from feeling guilty about making my parents spend money on me.and that guilt has followed me even now when I‚Äôm making my own money.

21242,"(Gonna be a little long, gonna rant a bit)

Little back story, 20-year-old male, no past history of major anxiety other than flying on planes etc..

Last year from January to April was feeling the best I have ever felt in my life! worked out 6-7 days a week, confidence was high, and not a care in the world. I would say around May, I started getting increasingly fatigued every day. As the days went on, it felt like I was detached from reality. By the end of the year, I felt so detached, fatigued, and had major brain fog. I have a small bump on the back of my head, it doesn't hurt, I got it checked out and the doc said it could be a skull deformity. I dont believe her.  I convinced myself that I had something wrong with me, and I went down the rabbit hole of self-diagnosing by reading google (i know worst idea ever). I could only function to the fraction I could before my snapping point. I felt so depolarized and had no energy at this point. I convinced myself I had a chronic illness that I was going to die from (I still belive this), I got every scan and lab work done. Nothing came of it. I had no idea what was causing all of these symptoms. Fast forward to January, I started a very stressful college class. It is an intensive academy-type class. I thought I had my stress pretty well controlled but in February I had my first panic attack ever. Went to school that day feeling fine, didn't eat breakfast, but drank 180mg of caffeine (I usually have \~300mg a day). During the afternoon portion of the class, I felt this sense of impending doom, and shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest.  For 2 hours my HR was in the \~130s. I had no Idea what was going on and felt like I was gonna die. So my teacher wanted me transported to the ER, My EKG came back normal, sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate). They pulled labs and everything was normal except for low magnesium and potassium. They gave me some fluids and discharged me. For the next few days my heart rate was a constant 120 even when resting and my anxiety was through the roof! It sucked! My doctor then prescribed me Lexapro, and man oh man, hats of to anyone that could get through that first phase of Lexapro. It trashed me, constant panic attacks, SOB, tingling, the whole 9 yards. I stopped after 5 days due to the fact that I didn't want to be tied to a pill at such a young age. Since my panic attack, Ive had constant anxiety. Im having anxiety about things Ive never worried about before! it sucks! Its like I have to experience all these things over again (like driving) to tell myself there is nothing to be anxious about. Ill also be sitting in the most comfortable place in my house, not stressed at all, then my heart rate will kick off to the \~120s for the whole day. Do you guys experience this? I also feel like I'm having heart palpitations. It feels like my heart is in my throat and I can't catch my breath. It sucks! Every time I stand up my heart rate jumps. It takes a long time for me to calm down and convince myself I'm not dying. I know my case is minor to some cases Ive read but damn Im having a hard time with this. Im in constant fear and anxious about having another anxiety attack and passing out. Im trying everything I can before I commit to an antidepressant. Im trying L  theanine, Ashwagandha, and magnesium. I got prescribed adarax but it doesn't seem to help like ativan does. I just want my old life back. Is this normal? Does it get better? will it be like this forever? how did you guys get over your anxiety? tips? medications? Thank you all for taking time and reading my post I really appreciate it. I just really need some help...",anxiety

21385,"It's not something I wanna do, but I'm made to do it. I had a root canal procedure because of an infection and my dentist recommends I get a crown for further stability. I personally think it's optional at the moment since it's my front tooth and it isn't subject to a lot of pressure. But you know, Asian parents, they're forcing me through it tomorrow. 

I'm so against getting a crown because it involves drilling away healthy tooth structure so that it will fit. It's permanent because tooth enamel can't grow back and so such a procedure I've been constantly anxious about it since the appointment got booked 3 weeks ago. Every day since, I've been dreaded for the day which is tomorrow. Has anyone had similar experiences or currently has a crown in their mouth? I'm worried about many things such as whether it feels like your natural tooth, whether it's the exact same color or a little bit off.",anxiety

So does anyone have some tips for me to build up the courage to just become a normal roommate.

21628,"I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me, and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions (like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way) has been the most life changing thing I've learned. I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people, but [here is a link](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/577d2ce937c58194f7d39816/t/60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa19/1623714139969/dbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf) to the PDF my group uses. The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods, and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you. My personal favorite is the TIP acronym - cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face, intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute, paced breathing or breath work (sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can), all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state. Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it. Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic. Just thought I'd share if anyone is looking for ideas. Love you all &lt;3",anxiety

21245,"I know I have some cavities because I went to the dentist sometime last year and they scheduled an appointment for fillings but when I showed up, no one was there and they wouldn't answer my calls for months so I gave up. But tonight I was looking at my teeth and I'm pretty sure I see one. I don't see any actual black or decay, just an indent that was hiding behind some tartar, but everyone's always told me that once you can see a cavity it's already too far and the tooth usually needs to be pulled (might not be true, just what I've been told) 
     I'm hopefully going to make an appointment on Monday but I'm so nervous because my teeth are terrible. I don't have any missing or rotting teeth but I can never remember to brush them and I had hg a couple years ago that turned into a 3 year long problem of throwing up multiple times a day. So they're yellow, have a ton of build up, and I'm pretty sure they told me I have gum disease at my last appointment. I'm so worried they're going to judge me and think I'm disgusting. I'm also terrified of getting fillings because the numbing shots never work fully for me so it's always super painful. 
     I checked their website and it says that they offer nitrous, conscious sedation, and iv sedation but I'm not even sure my insurance will pay for ""unnecessary sedation"" since nitrous makes me freak out.

22122,"By tomorrow night, I (21 y/o UK university student) have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far; the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes, vague ideas and research over the last few months, but I don't have a clue what to do with it, or where to start.

I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life, and until a few weeks ago, I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago, my motivation, self-belief and general ability to work (which were all low to begin with anyway) just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it). I missed the second one because of the same reasons, and because I failed the first one, so it didn‚Äôt make a difference if I missed the second one.

Since I got the email last week from my supervisor that I have to send him whatever I've been working on by tomorrow (Tuesday), I've not only not been working on the dissertation, but I've detached myself from it almost completely. I don‚Äôt like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it (literally and mentally) because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me (it was my choice after all) and i‚Äôve done a lot of research (too much I think) and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this (which is every time i‚Äôve ever done an assessment in my three years at university) it usually turns out alright, but I can't see how this one ‚Äî of course, the most important one ‚Äî will end in anything other than failure. So I‚Äôve come all this way ‚Äî from the start of uni three years ago, from the start of reception 17 years ago ‚Äî and I've always, at the very least, managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.

I‚Äôm aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time, or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all, and will all, get through it, and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they‚Äôre focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I‚Äôm not one of them. I know that I don‚Äôt belong here, and I don‚Äôt like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure ‚Äî the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally ‚Äî and that's what‚Äôs driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to, never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.

So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career ‚Äî I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future ‚Äî short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúwhere do you see yourself in five years‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you want to do with your life"" or even simply ‚Äúdo you have any plans for the weekend‚Äù, I‚Äôve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I‚Äôve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I‚Äôve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don‚Äôt remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.

In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years). I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.

If anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far ‚Äî and if you are a healthy, ‚Äònormal‚Äô person ‚Äî you will have obviously thought to yourself, ‚ÄúYeah, he needs therapy‚Äù. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There‚Äôs a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help‚Ä¶from anyone in fact. I think that‚Äôs the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I‚Äôd hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don‚Äôt think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone.

Yes.

21336,"28M.

I've had a lifelong fear of flying that feel well-prepared to take head-on, especially the fear I've had around taxiing and takeoff. I've flown before, but it's gotten harder to get through the process without running out of the airport dizzy, panicked and overwhelmed by guilt in the past few years.

Specifically, I took a program called SOAR designed to help fearful flyers manage their fight/flight responses around takeoff and aviophobia, or *fears when the plane is in the air.* I felt confident in the last few weeks that I could do this. 

But as I lay on my side writing this, I realize I was completely unprepared for the anticipatory anxiety ahead of the flight.

I woke up at 4 am this morning in a cold sweat. My extremities were numb. I couldn't get a 10-minute patch of sleep in without my stomach seemingly twisting into knots. The last 17 hours has been a waking nightmare of existing in a moderate to strong panic attack state. My appetite is nonexistent. I'm barely able to drink water. Every nerve in my body is screaming at me to tell my friends that I can't go on the spring break trip we planned.

It's crazy, I'm a grad student and I have never felt as tired as I do now just spending this day holding myself back from tears and a full breakdown. 

I'm so tired that a beach doesn't sound nice right now. I just want to curl up in my bedroom with no direct sunlight, to sleep, to cry, to indulge in self-hatred for having a response this extreme to something so commonplace in life for a lot of people. A vacation is the one thing I need right now, but trying to take one via flying has destroyed me. I'm lucky that I had nothing to do today, because it was not going to get done. 

I don't know if this thread is a message in a bottle, but it helps to get it out. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear it.

I still want to fly, deaparately. It's one of the big things keeping me from living my life on my terms. But having to spend almost 48 hours in utter hell is not worth it.",anxiety

21770,"I've had panic attacks and such, but one thing that's a bit more off and on is how anxiety affects my stomach. When I had daily stomach pains in elementary school that were unexplained - it now makes sense that it was definitely anxiety brewing.

I'm going through a period right now where my stomach is just revolting against me. I have the urge to go just about all day every day, and will sometimes go 2-4 times a day (when my usual is once a day), plus it's now usually loose, which wasn't an issue before.

The only thing I've found to kind of help is Tazo Zen tea. It does ease the stomach upset a bit, but I also can't drink THAT much of it before making myself nauseous/even more sick. How does everyone deal with this in terms of their anxiety? I only have this issue on weekdays when I have work, I'm usually normal on weekends, so it's obviously the anxiety. I just feel tortured by my stomach right now. I also meditate, which only helps for me while I'm actually doing it, so the anxiety comes right back as soon as I open my work computer, basically. 

Anything soothing for the stomach would be great... although I will say, I am currently dieting (wedding in June) and trying to stick to low-point foods/drinks on WW.",anxiety

22083,"Hello! After dreading going to a psychiatrist for a couple of months I finally got the courage to do it and this is a big step for me. 

The doctor prescribed me Enlift , Xanax and Magnesium (which I've heard good things about it in this subreddit). Ive only ever been prescribed Zoloft, tried it for about 3 months and it didn't work for me so I'm basically going in blind. 

The doctor told me some basic instructions as well as explained how they work but it doesn't ease my anxiety about them, especially Xanax. (I generally get a lot of anxiety about medications tho not just this kind) . I know medications like these aren't a one-size-fits-all but I think it would ease my anxiety to know some of your guys personal experiences with them. I think knowing I'm not alone in this will make it less scary for me, especially with the stigma in my country around any medication for mental health.

21805,"So the other day I had a full blown anxiety attack at work. All of the sudden my heart started racing, my whole body was shaking so bad, I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was terrified. The fact that this was happening at work made it 1000% worse. I was with a coworker, and had to run to the bathroom for like 10 minutes to try to calm down. I barely calmed down, but went back out to help customers. I was probably obviously shaking like a lunatic, but I did my best to work through it. I was honest with my coworker and told them what was going on.

This is a job that I've been doing on and off for several years. Nothing bad happened, but my life has been chaotic lately and it just snowballed right then and there. How do I get over the embarrassment of this happening not only in front of my coworker but customers too? I still don't know if my coworker told my boss, but if they had, I'm sure my boss would have reached out by now. The last time I had an anxiety attack this bad was about 2.5 years ago. So it's not a common occurrence, but when I go back to work I'm afraid of it happening again, or about repeat customers commenting on it. I just feel so ashamed and like a total loser. I'm in my mid twenties, this shouldn't be happening. I want to hide in bed forever.",anxiety

21421,"So back in 2017, I‚Äô‚Äù worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher as my first job. But after the busy season ended I was laid off. Not only that, but was basically laid off with no one even telling me since my boss at the time basically acted like I didn‚Äôt exist when I tried contacting them about potentially coming back. For roughly 5 years since, I basically jumped from one seasonal job to another. Then last year, I found myself being rehired in the same position, but this time the place is under new management. And honestly, I‚Äôve loved it. Not only is a job I enjoy with a salary that is better than I would have initially expected, but it also allowed me to make awesome new friends and get reacquainted with old ones. But since the start of the holiday season, I‚Äôve been off duty so to speak until the dining room opens back up in May. I‚Äôve recently found out in the company group chat that it will open up on Mother‚Äôs Day weekend, to which I responded roughly with ‚Äúawesome. So I guess that will be roughly when I‚Äôm coming back?‚Äù That was 2 days ago and since then the group chat had been dead silent. I‚Äôd assume it was cause everyone was busy and didn‚Äôt see, but the chat says that pretty much everyone saw it. And now it‚Äôs starting to feel similar to when I got laid off when I first worked there. And I don‚Äôt know why I would be since pretty much everyone has said how awesome I am for how hard I work and how good I am at my job. So, considering that, I may not have anything to worry about. But the fact that everyone saw that specific message yet didn‚Äôt say anything in response feels suspicious at the very least. What should I do? Do I have reason to worry or am I just worrying too much about nothing?",anxiety

I went for just a trim and to color my roots so I would have my normal chin length bob that I curl. It‚Äôs the best cut I‚Äôve ever had, however, my stylist (and I don‚Äôt blame him at all) misunderstood me because I communicated poorly and chopped off all of my hair, and stacked it so I have nothing but layers. To make it worse I‚Äôm prematurely gray, I thought it would be nice to blend in my natural gray streak with some color to highlight it but make it look a little more intentional. I now look like I‚Äôm a mix between Cruela De Vil and a 60 year old that screams at Target employees. I‚Äôm devastated. I‚Äôm mourning my hair and embarrassed to leave my home. I don‚Äôt even want to go for therapy today. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I know it grows back but to get to the point I want it will take over 6 months. I didn‚Äôt want a pixie and my jaw looks cartoonish. I‚Äôm not usually concerned how I look but I spent so much time trying to style it to fix it. I tried curling it to no avail. I tried to wet it down and with my natural hair I ended up a poodle.

21689,"Hello all,

I am 22M and been struggling since December when I had a marijuana induced panic attack. First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since it‚Äôs something she enjoys. Like an idiot, I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didn‚Äôt sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then I‚Äôve had constant derealization, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness, random headaches that come and go all over my head, body pains, stomach pain, etc..

Since then I‚Äôve had 2 rounds of blood work, CT scan, MRI, seen an ENT, and a neurologist. I‚Äôve also been given all of the following medications and more: prednisone, meclizine, clonidine, zyrtec, flonase, antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fair to diagnose as anxiety-related‚Ä¶ though my therapist (I‚Äôm new to therapy since this all began) says he‚Äôs never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and I‚Äôd say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so I‚Äôm still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for off-label use to begin with.

Overall I would say I am at about 25-30%. When I started the Zoloft I felt around 0-5% honestly. I was convinced I was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first 2 weeks.

I have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what I‚Äôm trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily, get outside, drive to my apartment (1hr), and work remote a few hours a day. I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when I‚Äôm busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25% awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing it‚Äôs own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but they‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs like being stuck in a dreaming state and it‚Äôs so scary and frustrating. It‚Äôs very hard to describe but I don‚Äôt have any delusions or hallucinations so I don‚Äôt believe I am suffering from a psychotic illness. 

I have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last 3 months have really tested me. Over the last 4 years I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression but I was able to power through 2 degrees, a long distance relationship, a breakup, and building a career I would hardly have dreamed of years ago. I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this, but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything I‚Äôd have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that it‚Äôs easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time, because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life. I‚Äôve learned lessons in gratitude, kindness, and compassion that I want to share with others.

P.S.
I really look forward to getting back to the things I enjoy once I‚Äôm better: bodybuilding, soccer, vinyls, and working!",anxiety

I have been diagnosed with GAD last year and still am discovering/recognizing all the different symptoms I have. Thank you for this wonderful community btw, I have cried at many of your stories and small victories.

I was wondering what your panic attacks / anxiety attacks feel like, and what difference you make between the two?

I keep telling therapists ""oh no I don't have panic attacks"" because in my mind if I'm not passed out on the floor then it's not it, but also I do have attacks of accute stress/rapid heart beat/can't breathe/need to move and get the f out of where I am which I don't know how to qualify. Looking for your experiences so I can put words on what I go through

21937," 

I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$&amp; out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway, yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe. Why am I like this?",anxiety

21795,"throwaway acc. a little bit about myself i‚Äôm a 23 F, bi in a very religious country, i have 9-5 job, shit family but i‚Äôm really used to it. 

after several suicidal attempts my last one was 9 months ago, not gonna go into details of how i did it but i had a very bad inflammation and stomach ache! did go to the hospital for ‚Äúbeing sick for no reason‚Äù, docs told me that my test all came back fine and i should just rest (not really sure how but i was glad). 

in the next days i had the worst chest pain i‚Äôve ever experienced and i definitely thought i was gonna have a heart attack and die, one day it got really bad and my heart raced like crazy and i was shaking but no one was around and after a couple of minutes i was ok. i guess it was a panic attack (never had one before) so i brushed it off like nothing happened. 


in the next months i have been having these weird chest pain i thought i had a problem with my heart, but as days went by i noticed that the pain gets so much worst when i think about certain things. i‚Äôve done so much to get rid of the pain yet it seems like it only gets worst.

i was watching a video on youtube the other day about a medical case and when they started to describe the symptoms that the patient had I HAD THE WORST CHEST PAIN SO FAR!! my heart was racing and my chest tightened i couldn‚Äôt breathe! 

googled it and got an ‚Äúanxiety test‚Äù, idk what to do. it really fucked me up i thought i was crazy. 

p.s: every time i get the chest pain i would google my symptoms and only get ‚ÄúHEART ATTACK‚Äù and ‚ÄúIMMEDIATELY CALL 911‚Äù, it makes the pain way worst‚Ä¶.

21660,"So, I've reached the point when I amassed enough courage to ask for an appointment with a psychiatrist. I've done therapy for about 5 years and never was brave enough to ask my therapist if I had either anxiety or depression. But 5 months ago I started with chronic tensional headaches - finished college and found two jobs, ended up very stressed, which I controlled after a neurologist prescribed me pregabalin. However, I've been struggling with other somatic symptoms that lead me to say, okay you waited too much, it's time to do it. Even though I hate the idea of being that self-diagnose person, I've been doing a lot of reflection and truly believe I have several symptoms of anxiety, perhaps social or general anxiety.

I will be seeing this doc (who was very recommended to me), and I fear judgment but much much more fear is if I get prescribed meds that mess me up worse. I know she's an outstanding professional, she has appropiately medicated my bf's niece for anxiety, and honestly doubt I'd need something ""strong"" but I'm so scared of start taking meds, I fear there's no turning back from it. I fear it changes me so badly that I have bad moments at my job in front of everyone, like crying or a panic attack, or that I make an embarrassment. I don't want to lose my job since it (there are two but the full time one) has helped me to get out of my lifeless and procrastination days. 

Haven't seen my therapist lately since she had a temporary license and now I'm also unsure if I should come back because she never made me a diagnosis. My general doctor told me to come back to therapy asap. 

Sorry for the long post - I'd like to know if someone relates to this or your experiences, but mostly if you know about meds and if I'm just panicking too much or maybe I just need to know this before meeting the psychiatrist.",anxiety
21559,"So I went to my GP (general practitioner aka your family doctor) and told her I had been feeling anxious lately, especially before big exams or oral presentations (I start shaking and feeling physically sick, unfocused, can't think straight, etc). She gave me a prescription for inderal and told me to take it on days when I have exams or big events.

However, I googled and it just looks like something to lower your blood pressure. So not that I'm complaining because, honestly, anything helps, but isn't this just going to treat the physical symptoms instead of the overlying issue aka the anxiety? It just sounds like I'll still have the mental anxiety, just with a lower heartbeat lmao

Has anyone tried this medication and has it worked for you? I'm not doubting my doctor but I'd like to know how it felt for other people",anxiety

21638,"I'm 23 and my anxiety started with health anxiety, and once I learnt how to deal with that it seems to have transformed into intrusive thoughts about past mistakes and how they could affect me now.

As a child or teenager (ages 10-18) I was just a really attention seeking person. I said lots of provocative jokes because I wanted to be different from everyone, and sometimes I lied about myself or my family or other things. I still have close contact with some of the people who I was friends with when I was a person like that. They don't ever bring up anything I said in the past and I don't feel judged by them because of those things.

 But it doesn't change the fact that I really hate myself for acting like that. My brain keeps reminding me of all of those things that I spent years not remembering. I know that regretting it means I have grown and am not that person anymore, but I still feel so guilty and feel like I don't deserve to forgive myself or move on. I feel like I should punish myself by remembering those things and never be able to live like they didn't happen. I really hate to think that I'm going to have to live my life having those memories and knowing it was me and noone else who used to act like that. I want to just focus on the present but I feel like I don't deserve it. I can't even force myself to study because it feels like I don't deserve to be successful in the future.

Does anyone have any advice regarding this? I spent the last 3 days beating myself up over something I said when I was 15... I just want to live without thinking about the past like I did before those intrusive thoughts were so intense",anxiety

22023,"If you have taken diazepam for one thing, not long term, can you please describe what happens? I don‚Äôt like not knowing, it is making me more anxious. Like will I feel trippy or sleepy or dopey? 

I have to have an MRI done on my head. First time I went I had a panic attack but got through it after 5 minutes, and they didn‚Äôt put headphones on my head under the coil (it‚Äôs like a head cage), which made me feel less trapped. I had to have a second MRI last month and I started crying as soon as I saw the machine, then when it came to having the coil and headphones on I had another panic attack. The first time I was on my own and didn‚Äôt properly recall that the headphones were a problem. I couldn‚Äôt do the second MRI. 

I‚Äôm going in to try again this Thursday and my GP prescribed me Diazepam. He didn‚Äôt really tell me what it will do to me in detail, just said it will make me less anxious.

Edit: I had the MRI! I made it through I am genuinely so proud of myself. I thought I‚Äôd share the experience in case anyone has a similar question and ends up here. 

Took one 5mg tablet an hour before the scan. I‚Äôm about 5 minutes I started feeling tired like I‚Äôd got up way too early or stayed up too late. 45 minutes later I was feeling really tired and a bit zoned like I‚Äôd had alcohol, drunk without the sick feeling. I got to the appointment and was a bit slow answering questions, mental lag sort of thing. Then in the machine I didn‚Äôt panic, I did feel the start of panic but it was very easily tampered down, like it was just a thought. The mri went well, got home and went sleep for 3 hours woke up tired still and a little bit sick, and then have slowly woken up more through the day.

22028,"I (25f) have been dating my boyfriend (33m) for two years now. We haven‚Äôt really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about 4 months ago. I‚Äôve had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with ADHD in January. My anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now, which I definitely took for granted. I‚Äôm on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level. 

About 4 months ago, my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason. Okay, great, I‚Äôm working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it, but my overall mental health is still going downhill. My boyfriend, luckily for him, has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me. I‚Äôve been working really hard to communicate with him about how I‚Äôm feeling and what I need, but he really just ignores it. 

For example, in January we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it. Traveling generally heightens my anxiety, especially international travel. A lot of little things happened (including a couple small actions he made) one day that led to an anxiety attack, and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening. A couple hours after I came down from the attack and I had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit, I talked to him about it a bit. I said ‚Äúyou can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it seems like you don‚Äôt know how to respond or support me when I‚Äôm having really bad anxiety moments like this,‚Äù he said yeah that‚Äôs true, so I asked if it would be helpful if I told him a couple things that help when I‚Äôm really struggling. He agreed, so I said a few things like getting me some cold water, giving me a hug/holding me, taking a walk with me if that‚Äôs an available option, things like that. He said he could work with that. Over the past two or so months since then, I‚Äôve had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one I had in January, and every time he basically ignores my anxiety. I‚Äôve repeated my request a couple times, but it doesn‚Äôt make any difference. (There are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well.) 

Over the weekend, we had a very short conversation (probably 5 minutes max) and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say. (None of this is necessarily in order, I really don‚Äôt remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting.) I said I wanted to try to make it work. I asked him if he wanted to try to make it work, and his response was ‚ÄúI want you to be happy, and I don‚Äôt want to be taking that from you whether it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not putting the effort in or unable to support you, or something else.‚Äù Which didn‚Äôt actually answer my question (I guess it did in a roundabout way, though). I also asked if he still loved me, and he paused for what felt like forever before saying ‚Äúyes.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve spent more time crying in the past two weeks than I have my entire life before this. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months. He‚Äôs not a very talkative person in general. If there‚Äôs an issue, he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesn‚Äôt actually bring it up. I feel like not only am I the only one that tries to open communication lines, but that I‚Äôm not getting my needs met also. 

I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about it a bunch, and I think I‚Äôve pretty much made my decision: I‚Äôm going to break up with him and work on my mental health. 

It feels terrible sitting on this, knowing the relationship is coming to an end. I have some major events coming up at work this week (including a 4 day long audit that I‚Äôm in charge of) so I‚Äôm basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible (I.e. the end of the week) and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work. Either way, I‚Äôm not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work, I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner. 

I‚Äôm struggling with feeling like I‚Äôm broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety. I know that‚Äôs not actually the case, but it sure feels that way. 

Anyway, thank you for listening. All my family lives out of state and I only have a couple friends, none of which I really talk about deep stuff like this with. I just want a hug. 

I apologize for the long post, I just wanted to get it off my chest.",anxiety

22074," **TL;DR: Having very mixed feelings over a reunion that I was not invited to but I feel I should have been, plus a former friend who socially traumatized me was invited**

Backstory: I am a pro player at a certain game. I went viral on YouTube and Reddit (different profile). The game's official YouTube channel's video of my gameplay has over 5M views and is the third most-viewed video on the channel. I had worked with the game's PR on stuff in the past and was always welcome at events and such.

I befriended many other players of this game over social media. I deactivated Facebook in early 2021 because I realized my mental health issues were showing and people were leaving group chats because of me and even unfriending me. I decided to deactivate before I ruined any friendships that meant a lot to me. I still maintain strong friendships with many of my fellow players.

For many years, the makers of the game said that they would never do a tournament or any kind of ""bring together the best players"" event because the player base is just too large and because the game is very luck-based (but if you're like me, you can sort of manipulate your odds). This year, a new person was put in charge of the game and they have decided to finally have a special event reuniting ""fan favorite"" players in person, most of whom went viral in the same way I did.

15 people were invited, and I was not one of them. The day the invitations went out, I got several messages from fellow players asking me, ""Did you get invited to the thing?"". Many in the community were shocked I was not, and one of them said ""They're missing out without you"". When I found out this was happening, I started trembling with anxiety for multiple reasons. One being that I was overthinking why I wasn't invited and paranoia that I may be blacklisted (I have been very vocal about the game's flaws on social media). One thing that got me was that around the time my gameplay was posted, I was often grouped with two other great players in promotional stuff and we were kind of like the de-facto ""GOAT trio""; we were the top three viewed videos on the YouTube channel at the time, though a couple have snuck between us since then. These two people were both invited to the reunion event. I am so happy for those who were invited and I'm trying to convince myself that not everyone could get this opportunity, but I can't help but feel hurt and worried.

The ""reunion"" happened today, and I purposefully avoided everyone's social media so I wouldn't have to see photos or anything of them hanging out at bars or restaurants and stuff afterwards. I suffer from FOMO big time. I've flown out to events that friends went to just to avoid FOMO, but I didn't have time to fly out for this reunion even to just stop by and say hi. The event is not being publicized until May, so I'm going to have to deal with this feeling again in a couple of months.

Part of the reason I am anxious about this whole thing is because one of the players who was invited to the reunion is a former close friend of mine. We bonded over the game of course, and his high score blew mine out of the water. We discovered we had a lot in common. He also suffers anxiety and he gave me advice on what meds are better than others; I still take the one he recommended me to this day. We're also both gay, and I found him very attractive (as did many others in our community). Our friendship shattered when I went to visit him in person (across the country) and he showed very manipulative behavior that I was too naive to discern at the time. He purposefully distanced himself from me whenever we were in a room together (e.g. sitting on a different couch) and excluded me from ""parties"" he went to while I was in town to prevent anything sexual happening between us, and lying about them. He had been sending me several pictures of him shirtless and in bed with other guys we knew, knowing it would turn me on, among many other forms of leading me on, but never had the courage to say ""I don't like you like that"". Instead, he let me come all this way and then gaslit me for trying to come on to him, saying it was inappropriate behavior (behavior that he exhibited with other guys right in front of me, and said ""It's different with them"" when I asked). We tried to move on from that experience while staying friends, but then he kept making jokes about me with the other guys and I got tired of it. We haven't spoken in months, and when we did speak, it was only because he had a question about the game.

I suffered so much social trauma from this person I trusted, and his group of friends who seemed like a Mean Girls Plastics clique that acted polite around me but I later realized they didn't care about me one way or the other. I followed all of them on Instagram and only one followed me back. These people ostracized and humiliated me on top of my friend's various forms of mental and emotional abuse. The trauma only started setting in as months passed and I started crying myself to sleep and sort of ""reenacting"" the day everything happened in my head wishing I was more assertive. Now I get PTSD at the mention of his name, and I deleted almost every picture I took on my trip to meet him. So since he was invited to the reunion, I might have declined if I was invited so I wouldn't have to be in the same room as him, because it would have been so triggering for me and I would not have been able to concentrate on the game. That being said, I would definitely be willing to take a day to have a serious discussion with this person over how he made me feel and maybe we could start over strictly as friends, because I do think he is a good person.

I really hope come May when the reunion is made public that I don't suffer any more PTSD. I hope I can find some healthy distractions.

21373,"(Sorry for the bad english or any grammar mistake :D )

I've been dealing with my anxiety since I was 17. Since then, I've been looking for ""triggers"" that makes me feel more anxious. Like a pattern. So I could deal better with it (I dont have any pro help). I've realized that my anxiety gets worse when I have to talk with people. So, I've been trying to better my communication. And Im better, actually. I'm feeling more calm around other people. 

But there is something that it's haunting me since I'm trying to better my anxiety. I realized that there are some people that makes me worse. Sometimes even colleagues. For some reason, when I see them or talk with, I have a bad feeling, a heavy energy, and my anxiety explodes. Because of that, I cant trust on them. And I'm always in the ""alert mode"" when I'm around them. I don't know if this is a problem that my anxiety creates in my mind or if it's something that other people also feels.

That's why i'm here. I'm trying to understand if the problem is me and my anxiety or them. Anyone feels like this around some people?

I know that I know how to do most of my job. But I‚Äôm petrified of things that haven‚Äôt happened yet, or that I think will happen.

A cycle of living in fear of everything I worked for falling apart..just because I‚Äôm having crippling anxiety the last few months.

Its so frustrating to even look at myself be this way knowing how hard i can work. Instead, I‚Äôm here panicking internally about everything happening all the time, whats due, whats coming up, not really being 100% clear on anything.


Its been a very difficult two years for me and i feel like its all coming down at once ..after just drowning it all on micro distractions to keep my mind at bay.

21240,"I‚Äôve been dealing with some anxiety issues my whole life. I‚Äôve had lots of trama and was diagnosed with ADHD as a young child. Never being able to focus and always the most loud and distributive( in school). I used to stay up at night as a kid because after watching the slightest scary movie I would be afraid. Anyways the point of the backstory is to give you a sense of who I was. Lately within the past year my anxiety has been through the roof. I find it very hard to focus and have lots of thoughts at once. Even some that just pop into my head. I can hear other peoples tone of voice. Not like big conversation. My anxiety was so high I was getting lots of physical symptoms heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath to which I thought I had a heart problem. So I went to the doctors and got all the tests and didn‚Äôt believe my heart was fine until I got the results. I thought about this everyday. To which now I think this might had been a delusion. My point is I‚Äôm very worried I‚Äôm developing Schizophrenia. My family does have a history of mental health issues.I know this post is confusing and if I‚Äôm worried about my mental health I should see a doctor. But I‚Äôm just looking for advice.

**Edit**

But a desperate man in desperate times, or however the saying goes lol.
However, my physical symptoms have not left. My chest constantly feels heavy and i cannot get a good breath. I almost have to force myself to yawn to feel like im getting that ‚Äúdeep breath.‚Äù It‚Äôs affecting my life, mostly limiting my physical movements and causing headaches, assuming from constantly forcing a deep breath. I don‚Äôt have a pcp i can call for advice. But I feel like enough is enough and i would like to be able to breathe normally again. My mom has copd so I have a pulse ox around and my oxygen has been consistent at 98/99, so i can (mostly) confidently say this is anxiety. 
My issue is, do i call a doctors office and wait weeks to be seen? Or go to an urgent care, pay $150 for them to tell me this is just anxiety? 
Ultimately, what are my options here? I just want to feel normal again",anxiety

21782,"I'm 30 years old male from M√©xico.

Since mid january almost to today, I'm been having everything, chest pains, chills, heartburn and I feel the pain in the chest, arms, neck and sometime in the teeth because of clenching my jaw, also burping and yawning like crazy.

I've done 3 electrocardiograms in lest than a month and everything came out ok, no hypertrophy, not ischemia, nothing, a healthy heart.

I've been into ER three times, the second the most severe I had everything, chest pain, brain zap, stomach felt like it collapse and when I got connected into a machine and they told me that I had nothing, I was fine, my lungs where ok and my heart was ok, when they told me that, all the feelings went dissapearing slowly to feel normal again. And this happend the the third time, when I got severe chest pain, the ambulance came to My house and the paramedics connected me into an electrocardiogram machine and told me that I was ok, My heart was ok only that I need to check my pressure because was a bit high and as I was ok they didn't take me to a hospital, I went to ER anyways to check my pressure and again I was ok a bit high but nothing to hospitalize me.

In the end I've been with m√∫ltiple doctors even a friend that is also a doctor and they told me the same, I'm at zero risk from a heart attack right now, I'm physically healthy, my collesterol levels are ok, a bit high in the ldl side, but everyone told me that is nothing to worry about.
And in the last electro with the chest pain, something should have come out if it was really the heart and that I wouldn't be able to talk or walk as I was everytime. My friend even told me that I wouldn't be there with him as with younger people it tend to be more painfull and more fatal.

So in the end the only thing I have left is to accept my anxiety, but I don't know how, every time I want to believe is anxiety, something new comes out and make me doubt about my heart health, I'm literally going crazy. I also being doing things like running and long walks to see if I get unusally tired but that never is the case.

What advice can you give me to deal with this, have any of you have pass for something similar??

21298,"The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn‚Äôt anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it‚Äôs because I started a new job last month and I‚Äôm falling back into my old health anxiety habits because ‚ÄúStress compounds symptoms‚Äù. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven‚Äôt even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I‚Äôm fine I thought I‚Äôd be okay but I‚Äôm still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I‚Äôm calm it doesn‚Äôt go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can‚Äôt stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that‚Äôll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It‚Äôs just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165. This constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life. How do I stop this??",anxiety

21851,"Started thinking about this today when out for a walk as I noticed myself constantly touching my bellybutton and stomach when I was starting to feel that tight, anxious feeling. I seem to do this without thinking and I am sure to people walking past, it looks a bit strange! I remember also in the past when I would get anxiety attacks or feelings of even slight panic, I would start touching my neck (maybe almost unconsciously due to my breathing). Not sure if it helps, but when I am not able to do it easily (say when driving or holding something) I feel a bit worse if that makes sense.

 These habits have developed very randomly for me over time and seem to come out as soon as I start having symptoms of anxiety and anxious thoughts. Just thought I'd ask if any of you have any strange practices you do, maybe even as a coping mechanism or way of bracing yourself when your anxiety is heightened. 

Anxiety is a strange kettle of fish but hope everyone is coping in their own way and getting through it one day at a time.",anxiety
21960,"I‚Äôm trying to figure out and address an issue I‚Äôve had my entire life (or at least as long as I can remember). As I try to seek out treatment and help, I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here can relate.

I will obsess and fixate on completely mundane things. For example: If I overhear someone taking about a movie but I don‚Äôt know what the movie is, I may fixate on ‚ÄúWho did they say the lead was? An Australian named Ben. What was the movie? What was the movie???‚Äù and my heart will start racing and my breathing will get shallow and I‚Äôll need to get up and walk around. 
Another example might be for me to see a photo of myself reading and I‚Äôll obsess, wanting to figure out what the title of the book is that I‚Äôm reading. 
I might also obsess wondering what a logo on a shirt is, who was that guy that I helped with a flat tire that seemed so familiar, etc. 
You know how sometimes people will hear a song and not know what it is and they‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúWhat IS that song? It‚Äôs going to drive me nuts?‚Äù For me it feels like that ‚Äúgoing to drive me nuts‚Äù thing is for real. 
These ‚Äúattacks‚Äù might also occur in certain circumstances of guilt or self-loathing.

22152,"am a 19-year-old college student, trying to make the best of my life despite my past. Growing up, I had a difficult childhood. My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons. I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone, but it never worked.

My mom was an alcoholic, and she never showed me any love or affection. She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life. I felt like I was all alone in the world, and I had no one to turn to.

As a result of my childhood, I developed a deep sense of trust issues. I find it hard to open up to people and let them in. I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way, just like my father and stepfather did.

But despite all of this, I refuse to let my past define me. I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me. College has been a fresh start for me, and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me.

However, even with my newfound friendships, I still find it hard to trust people. I am always on guard and keep people at arm's length, afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did.

Sometimes, I wish I could forget about my past and start anew, but it's always there in the back of my mind, haunting me. It's hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today.

But I refuse to let my past hold me back. I am determined to overcome my trust issues and build a better future for myself.",anxiety

22024,"

Long term Klonopin??

I am a 20 y/o male with fairly bad anxiety. Have tried every ssri in the book none of them work and give me horrible side effects. 

My anxiety is as follows: completely random attacks, feel like I‚Äôm dying I went to the er many times. I can‚Äôt process thoughts in my head pretty much 24/7 (hard time holding conversation). I will sometimes have attacks with stressful situations at work, but I have an important job so I don‚Äôt let those attacks stop home from doing my job even tho it can be miserable. 

I have tried many different ssri, hydroxzyine which works sometimes. The only thing that has worked is Xanax. I‚Äôm prescribed 1mg, but I typically break it up and take .25-.5 as needed. The only thing I haven‚Äôt tried is a beta blocker which I will try next.

Xanax allows me to have a perfectly clear head. I don‚Äôt feel like a retard and trip over my words and feel disassociated when I am on it. I don‚Äôt feel sedated or tired I just feel normal. It curbs and prevents panic attacks for usually 6-10 hours. I have been taking it more than I should recently .25-.5 every day to every other day. I do notice some rebound anxiety on the days off but nothing too crazy.

If a beta blocker doesn‚Äôt work I will try clonazapam. I really don‚Äôt care about dementia later in life. So my question is if these drugs increase my quality of life dramatically should I really avoid them just because of withdrawls? Yes I know their hell but you don‚Äôt go through them if you are on em for long term with no intention of getting off.

21332,"Hi, looking for a bit of advice and experiences from r/anxiety here.

Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks. For most of my life I've always been a little anxious and tended to overthink, but these symptoms were just much worse. Up to this point I've also been smoking weed, but not excessively, mostly once a week. After developing said disorder, weed now increases my symptoms, despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down. Even when I had a greenout, I mainly suffered physical symptoms. 

In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training, a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month. With this I got the worst of it under control. Since then I've been smoking a few times with mixed results, sometimes I get more anxious and panicky, but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high. 

Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse, depending on the day, so I'll definitely quit weed until I can resolve this. My question now is, if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again? I'll be honest, I quit enjoyed being high, so that would be quite the bummer, but certainly not the end of the world.

Thanks in advance!",anxiety

I‚Äôve started struggling with really bad brain fog and confusion and it‚Äôs really freaked me out lately. I‚Äôve been unable to work since mid last year and still live with my brother and mom. My dad moved about 30 mins away a year and a half ago after my parents got divorced but they stayed friends.

The past few months have been hell, dealing with the brain fog on top of the other issues, and not being able to find a doctor to take me seriously. I‚Äôm surely at a loss. My mom has began dating again and is legitimately obsessed with online dating. Buying every membership to every site imaginable, talking to a different guy every night and most nights she‚Äôs going out. Now this probably wouldn‚Äôt bother me but when I have so much going on, sometimes I just need someone to talk to. 

I was always extremely close to my mom, she has always been there for me but lately she really doesn‚Äôt even seem to care. Her only worry is that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre going to hurt yourself‚Äù but she doesn‚Äôt want to do anything to help me. She told me this morning that she wants me to go stay with my dad and I‚Äôm so hurt. I‚Äôve lived here for 24 years and I just want to feel clear headed again. Idk what to do and I feel like my parents hate me. I honestly feel like I have nobody.

I do go out with friends a lot of nights or just hangout to get out of the house, I workout so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just sitting at home waiting for her.

21230,"Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? 
I went to doctors yesterday, didn‚Äôt see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op‚Äôs check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre looking to discuss pain management‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I‚Äôm annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I‚Äôm on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you‚Äôll have review soon with usual GP to see if it‚Äôs helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you‚Äôve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn‚Äôt really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I‚Äôm worried now that it will be on my notes and I‚Äôm also frustrated that I didn‚Äôt correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don‚Äôt like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse. I‚Äôm struggling mentally very very bad to say the least.",anxiety

Anyways got a dm about an hour ago from a dude, real creep, knew from the first message, but that fucked up part of my brain wanted to see where it went for some reason.

Like, to lose a partner, not have a family, etc. I feel like it‚Äôs just for me to lose out on something because she got something taken away too. I definitely faced consequences - the teachers didn‚Äôt like me as much afterwards and I got excluded from a party as well.

I keep punishing myself and wonder if there‚Äôs a karmic force out there that will punish me. Do I deserve punishment? Should I just let myself be happy? I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy. I‚Äôm not sure if this is my anxiety talking though.

21438,"I know that sounds like a really dumb and childish question.

 I have a crush on a girl. My brother is friend's with her brother. My brother and her are also friends and seem to talk often. 

She had a crush on and liked my brother at some point, maybe she still does, I have no idea. 

Sadly, we never really talk or anything, especially outside of social gatherings where the whole ""group"" is already hanging out. I spoke directly to her, and vice versa a handful of times yesterday while we were all hanging out. 

It was kind of me just speaking for the sake of speaking, I didn't go out of my way to do it too much though because I was very anxious, nervous, and insecure around her.

Anyway, we've never interacted on social media, and she hasn't followed me or anything even though she probably knows that I have some social media accounts, for example, on Twitter she has most likely seen me reply to my brother's tweets.

Am I just being childish and over-analyzing social media?

I'm afraid she thinks I dislike her, and or dislikes me.

She probably thinks I'm weird anyway. I don't think she would like me or find me attractive in any way. I think she can tell I'm ambitionless and socially awkward and maybe mentally a little odd.",anxiety

21590,"Hello! 

I have always been anxious, and as of 2-3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I've been in therapy for years and tried all sorts of medications (Lexapro, Zoloft, medical marijuana, CBD, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax, Amitriptyline), and the only thing that worked were the benzos. I'm extremely lucky to have an NP who fills my Xanax refills. The problem is... I don't want to be addicted to this medication. I take it very sparingly, which is why it works so well, but I only take these when I feel nauseous/jittery/panicky, which, fortunately, is not 24/7. However, I do have GAD pretty bad. In the shower, thoughts just race and I can't find the ""off"" switch. It's ruined my sleep. It's taken a dump on my memory. I just cannot live like this anymore. 

Meditations help in the moment I do them, but I feel like I need to be medicated. I was on Zoloft for about 6 months, and it helped tremendously, but when I tried getting back on it (I properly titrated my dose when I get off them), for some reason the side effects were extremely unbearable. Granted, I started back at 50mg, when before I was on it for 25mg for a week and then 50mg the second week and continued for 4-6 weeks. It could also be that at the time I could tolerate medical marijuana, but now, that makes me either anxious/jittery or straight-up nauseous. 

Lexapro? Forget it. I started at 10mg, and that was a nightmare. I was so nauseous by day 2, if it wasn't for my anti-nausea med, I would've projectile vomitted all over my kitchen floor. The other time I was at 5mg, and I felt so cracked out. 

I also don't like that SSRIs are rough on my body for 4-6 weeks. Maybe that's just the gamble you take, but I hate having increased anxiety, inability to ejaculate, and horrendous stomach pains for a month. Does that sound like fun to anyone? 

I took amitriptyline, and that was more for chronic pain, and it barely did anything, and as for anxiety, I didn't notice much of a difference either, and I tried this medication at 10 and 25mg.

I have an appointment with my NP tomorrow, and she is well aware I struggle with anxiety. Is there a medication that's not an antidepressant that works for GAD and is not a benzo, meaning I can take as often as needed? 

I've also tried supplements like L-Theanine, Melatonin, and Ashwagandha, and they don't do crap. 

Any experiences with non-antidepressants that worked for you?",anxiety

When are brains are overloaded with stress hormones it goes berserk. As I've learned to accept my symptoms as a part of my anxiety &amp; not fight or repress them, it's alot easier to manage.""Anxiety will not kill me"" is my mantra.

21306,"I (23F)  have a pretty okay relationship with my boyfriend's (24M) family. His mom is a devote Christian and her and  I are pretty close and his brother (let's call him Jake) and I are okay as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I follow the little brother who is 16 on Instagram and we occasionally interact (liking stories, pics,etc). Yesterday I remembered that my friends and I created a 'burner' account 3 years ago that we used to look and follow people we didn't know (crazy I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I noticed that Jake was following this burner. I looked at his profile as saw a bunch of stuff posted that I have never seen before. It was typical teenage boy stuff like rap music, middle fingers in pictures, etc. but nothing that I haven't seen before. I realized that I was blocked from viewing these stories and unblocked whenever he posted other stuff. I instantly started to feel sick and uneasy at the thought him blocking and unblocking me each time. I even felt a little teary. I thought, does he think I am uncool? Old? Did he think I was going to tell his mom? I also post things with cursing etc. so I really felt confused. I know in reality it is really not that deep because I too have older adults in my life 'blocked' from viewing my story but the feeling I felt was uncontrollable. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have felt similar to this in other occasions and another user asked if I had rejection sensitive dysphoria. I am not sure if I do.

TLDR: Boyfriend's little brother blocked me from viewing his story and I instantly started to feel uneasy.",anxiety

22109,"TL;DR: Dad gave me edible without my knowledge/consent, I had a really bad trip, now I don't know how to deal with it.

Hey, not sure if this is the best place to post this. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for exactly - to vent? To know if someone had a similar experience? I don't know.

Last month I was staying at my dad's house. One night, I was sitting in the living room while he and his wife were in the kitchen nearby. I wasn't paying any attention to them; I was playing a video game on my dad's laptop. I had headphones on, with one ear uncovered because I was also watching The Simpsons. So I didn't know what they were talking about.

My dad came up to me and held out what seemed to be this gummy candy. I don't remember if I asked what it was; whether I did or not, he was just like ""Try it."" Now, the thing about my dad is that this sort of thing isn't unusual; I'm used to him making me try weird foods and such. So, perhaps foolishly, I ate it without really questioning it (it tasted vile). It was only after I had already swallowed it that he told me it was an edible.

Now, another thing about him is that a lot of times he likes to mess with me. Once, when I was a teenager, for example, he gave me a drink and told me it had alcohol when it really didn't. So I wasn't sure if he was lying or not. I knew he and his wife sometimes took edibles, I just...didn't know they had any at the time. I had never done drugs before, and I don't think I would have eaten it if I had known.

After that, he and his wife went to bed. About an hour or so passed, then it began kicking in. I started feeling dizzy, and I got kind of scared, so I went into their bedroom and I asked my dad if it really was an edible. He said ""No."" This was a lie, but obviously I didn't know it at the time.

I decided the best thing to do was try to get some sleep. There was only one bedroom, so I had been sleeping on a mattress in the corner. So I was lying there, crying because I had no idea if what I was feeling was because I was high or if it was all in my head.

My dad's wife was also high, and she started talking to me. I started laughing, things got kind of funny...I started talking about all of my interests (much to my dad's annoyance, as he was trying to sleep), and I said some really embarrassing things (I later found out he had recorded at least most of what I said...well, yelled, 'cause apparently when I'm high I get really loud). I have selective mutism, so I tend to have a lot of trouble talking if I'm not really comfortable (it's gotten better over the years, but my dad is convinced that I don't actually have it or something)...

Anyway, at some point, I fell asleep and had a horrible nightmare. It's hard to describe, but it involved me forgetting everything...my life, my interests, the people I knew and the world around me...I dreamt that my dad knew I was going to forget it all, and I remember the fear I felt in the nightmare. Just that feeling of...""Why? Why would he do this to me?"" I tried to recall faces - mine, my dad's, a musician I have a crush on (yeah, weird, I know)...and everything was warped, grotesque. Everything became a black void (you know that scene in Spongebob where Squidward's in that ""Alone"" place? Kind of like that, except black instead of white). I began thinking that maybe I had died, or was dying, and that this horrible void was the afterlife.

I woke up sobbing and screaming ""Oh God!""/""Oh Lord!"" over and over (and also yelling at my dad ""How could you do this to me!?"" and ""I will never forgive you!"") He and his wife got me up from the mattress and had me drink some water. Everything during this part and afterwards felt like a dream that I was trying to wake up from.

My dad made me some oatmeal and put on some songs by one of my favorite artists (American Murder Song). In my disoriented state, I remember thinking that the first song he put on was familiar, and that if I could just hang on to that familiar feeling everything would hopefully be okay. I vaguely remember singing along to the songs.

After I ate he put on one of my favorite movies (Repo! The Genetic Opera) and left me in the living room. I remember it being on, but it felt almost like I was half asleep or something throughout. I was just anxious and confused, and I was trying to focus on the movie but I kept...I don't know, it was like going in and out of consciousness or something. There's a scene towards the end of the movie where the main character falls unconscious and I remember vaguely wondering if perhaps I was actually her (I'm a guy, not that it mattered to my drugged self) and that I would wake up and the movie would be reality.

Apparently, I also sang along to the whole move, but I don't remember this (my dad came into the room to check on me at some point and he said I seemed to be having a great time, but I know I really wasn't). I do remember, however, that at some point I threw up all over myself. After the movie, I told my dad I threw up and he was mad that I was too disoriented to clean it up myself. By this point, about six hours had passed since I had taken the edible. I remember being so confused I asked him what day it was. After that, I went back to sleep.

The next day, my dad told me that it really was an edible...so I did feel somewhat relieved that it was actually a drug that was making me feel that way. But for about three days afterward I still felt the affects of it...and for about a week or so I kept experience derealization.

My dad's reason for giving me the edible...he said he thought it would make me talk more...which it did, but it was humiliating. Apparently, he and his wife had talked about what was in it before he gave me the edible, but (as my cousin pointed out to me) it's strange to just assume that I'd be paying attention to a conversation that I wasn't even part of, even if I was in the room. So he apparently thought I knew what it was...

I wasn't able to go home immediately (he lives in another state so he had to buy a plane ticket and all that), but when I eventually did I told my mom what happened. She's furious at my dad, though neither of us have spoken to him about it. I talked to my therapist about it recently, but her reaction seemed...dismissive (like, she thought it was cool that it made me talk about my interests, but again...I had no consent).

So here I am, exactly a month after it happened...I still experience derealization if I think about it (parts of the nightmare I mentioned I literally only remembered last night...). I just...I don't know how I'm going to get over this. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to, for example, watch ""Repo!"" again...just recently I listened to one of the songs my dad had put on and it gave me a weird feeling in my stomach. I'm trying to decide whether or not to cut ties with my dad...(this isn't the first time I've thought about it, to be honest, but I'm seriously considering it now). I just know now that thinking about that nightmare still terrifies me...",anxiety

21650,"I wish these past few months were all a joke. Life really said, ‚ÄúOh, let‚Äôs make all these bad things happen to her and see her suffer, yay!‚Äù Bonus points because Life made my hereditary anxiety pop out at full force to. 

It first started when my dog started to act not normal. Her head would keep tilting every which way like she was drunk and eventually kept looking at the ceiling. It got so bad to the point where she couldn‚Äôt walk or wouldn‚Äôt eat anymore. It got worse during the weekend and we don‚Äôt have an emergency vet near us so we had to call an on call vet from our clinic to come and look at her. He didn‚Äôt really say much about her, just figured that it was neurological. My mom planned to bring her back to her regular vet on Monday so they could further help her. She kept having seizures throughout the day as well and had labored breathing. My mom laid with her on the couch at night and watched the clock, waiting for 7 am to arrive. My dog didn‚Äôt make it through the night. She died at 3 in the morning. 

I woke up that morning to my mom and dad telling me that she passed away. I got up out of my bed and quickly walked to the living room because I wanted to be with her. She died laying in her little bed that she loved. My family came and sat around her, crying and telling her that we love her. I didn‚Äôt want it to be real. I wanted to say, ‚ÄúMom, dad, she‚Äôs just sleeping she‚Äôll wake up and start barking any minute.‚Äù But reality came back and that‚Äôs when I knew, this is really happening. 

I went to school the next day. I didn‚Äôt want to. I just wanted to stay in my bed all day and sleep. I was so tired. I couldn‚Äôt even pay attention to what the professor was saying because I felt numb and detached from reality. After I got out of class I started feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It hit me like a ton of bricks. My chest hurt bad too. I started to take my anxiety pills again after that. 

I never had anxiety this bad before. I realized it‚Äôs not like a cold that you can shake off. It sticks with you everywhere you go for a long time. I started off getting shortness of breath and chest pain. Then it turned into feeling like my skin and heart were on fire and panic attacks that would jolt me awake at night and keep me up until 6 am. It did get better with time once I learned how to manage it. 

A few weeks later I was sending out reminders to my bridesmaids that dress shopping was coming up. I had reminded them months before because I wanted to make sure everyone could be there. I hadn‚Äôt heard from one of my bridesmaids in about a month so I reached out to her to see if she was doing ok. She hadn‚Äôt given me a response. The next day I asked if she was still coming, no response. On Saturday, we arrived to the boutique to pick out bridesmaid dresses. She didn‚Äôt text or call and didn‚Äôt show either. She finally texted me the day after telling me she was backing out of being a bridesmaid. I was fine with that but wish she had communicated with me better. 

A few days after that I found a couple of black scuff marks on my car. There‚Äôs a little crack by the marks to. Turns out somebody side swiped my car and I didn‚Äôt even see it until now. I figured I probably got hit in the college parking lot while I was in class so I called college security and had to meet up with an officer to give them specific time frames to look at in their security camera footage. I‚Äôm so sick of people hitting my car. I think my car has gotten hit about 5 times now. I got so anxious about telling my dad.

I hope Life gives me a break after this. I desperately need one.",anxiety

22015,"TW CLIMATE CHANGE

I am 22 yo and I've been studying to become a lawyer for the past 6 years.

I'm on the verge of finishing my studies and I ask myself: what's the point?

How are we supposed to keep living as if things were normal, as if Society was not rushing towards a brick wall?

I've been worried about the environment for years, especially feeling helpless and seeing governments and multinationals not giving a damn.

In order not to be crushed with worry, I held onto the idea that, at worse, our generation would be okay and it's the next one which would suffer the big consequences.

In reality, it's hard to be that optimistic, especially as IPCC reports get more serious and worrying every time they're issued.

The idea that Society is on the verge of collapse feels more realistic as time goes by. I'm scared that it will not be able to adapt to climate change, that we will die or live in a post-apocalyptic world.

I'm scared and I feel helpless, especially as a future lawyer because I don't see the use in lawyers in such a situation. I'm feeling depressed because I feel like my studies are pointless. I don't see how lawyers can be useful to save the world. 

I feel like it's too late for lawyers to be helpful in urgent times, as law is such a slow process. I feel like what we need are people in the field; scientists, real politicians, essential jobs, etc.

22115,"Yesterday I attended my boyfriend's cousin's wedding and wore a short cream-colored dress with a black pattern. The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed. I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy, and that's as far as my brain got.

At the reception, my boyfriend's mom spilled red wine on my dress. As I tried to dab out the stain, I caught myself saying ""see, this is why I never wear white""--and then it hit me. I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change. I felt like such an asshole, such an idiot, and I still can't shake that feeling.

I sat in the second-to-last row at the ceremony, at the very end of the row away from the aisle -- thank God. It was a casual wedding. People were there in jeans. No one said anything to me. And it was genuinely an accident. A very stupid accident. But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriend's extended family, and I'm now convinced they all hate me. I can't think about anything else. I feel like such a fuckup, like I'm a bad person.

the thing is, i woke up sexually turned on. but at the same time, i am scared and guilty. i am anxious because why did i wake up sexually turned on with a dream that had children in it, violence and me forcing a guy to have sex with me???? and watching and leading him to have sex with children.. 

i am panicking. i am absolutely panicking.

I‚Äôve been dealing with bowel mouvements when facing a stressful event, which is, annoying but I deal with it. I rush to the toilets and I‚Äôm good.
I read that during a fight or flight episode, your body wants to removes its wastes. Be it. 

Problem is, a few hours later, I have to deal with severe cramps in my lower abdomen. I do not understand why I get that, and it‚Äôs pretty annoying since usually, the stressful events happen mid-day, and I get the cramps from 8pm to 5-6am. I can barely move, even breathing hurts. But I manage to fall asleep either way.

Yesterday, I had to deal with that /again/, and it was much stronger than usual. I felt like someone was stabbing my lower left area, every 3-4 minutes. 

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone had had that before, what exactly happens inside that causes that, and if there‚Äôs anyway to either prevent or help with ot when I have it?
Hot water bottles and massages don‚Äôt work. ü•≤

However, the past 2 weeks have been really really hard with my health anxiety and I knew I needed to finally get back on and I‚Äôm so happy to be back on. I had some stomach issues and I‚Äôm freaking out. I had blood in my stools and bad pains in my pelvis. I also for the past 2 months have had a dull ache in my upper left abdomen. Had some blood and stool tests and all was good. Today is day 2 is taking my medication (Zoloft) and I have a weird, nauseating feeling in my throat/chest. It feels exactly like when you get super giddy and your chest/throat squeals with excitement. But I don‚Äôt feel excited- I feel so anxious. It‚Äôs almost like I have to gag or dry heave. Can the Zoloft be causing this? I had no side effects last time I was on it so it‚Äôs weird. My anxiety is going crazy because I‚Äôm afraid it has to do with my other symptoms.",anxiety

21671,"I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

Damn it, I don't know what I want to hear from you, to be honest, I mean I already am so filled with self-hatred and hatred for the world, I am working myself into anger just writing about it.",anxiety

22058,"Hello all! I‚Äôm new here. I recently decided to take a break from a problematic drinking habit and found that I had been self medicating for anxiety more than I realized, as it sprang back with a fury. 

I decided to go back on ssri‚Äôs, fluoxetine (generic Prozac) specifically. I figured it would help me with the depression and anxiety as my brain healed. I‚Äôve been abstinent from alcohol for 82 days now. The first few days of fluoxetine were amazing, but then mid last week I started feeling really, really anxious. Like, unprovoked, where are these waves of intense anxiety coming from? anxiety.

I‚Äôve been on anti depressants in the past, so I‚Äôm no stranger to their effects, but I don‚Äôt remember having this negative of a reaction. Ive been trying every coping mechanism I know. I have a very supportive family and am seeing a therapist, so I‚Äôll get through this. It‚Äôs just extremely uncomfortable. 

Did I mention that I‚Äôm a middle school music teacher? It‚Äôs really hard to stand up in front of a room of adolescents and conduct a rehearsal when you are in full fight or flight mode. 

Anyone else have this experience? I read several posts on here from people saying that the ssris fixed the depression, but not the anxiety. I am hoping for more positive results in the long run. Have a great one!",anxiety

21490,"This girl was cool when I first met her. But then she started being really annoying and I didn‚Äôt feel like being her friend anymore. I would tell her something she didn‚Äôt agree with and then at 1 am she‚Äôd send these blocks of texts saying she hated herself and that I was selfish and didn‚Äôt really care for her etc. Sometimes I just stop texting my friends for personal reasons and go a few days without replying. This was never a problem for my long-term friends, but apparently it was for her. I had to step on eggshells to talk to her and I didn‚Äôt like it.

if anyone wants more context let me know, but in short I just didn‚Äôt want this person in my life anymore. 

I always knew she needed help so that‚Äôs why instead of telling her to fuck off like some people suggested I did, I would just let her know when I didn‚Äôt like something she said/did but not be mean about it. She would apologize for overreacting, I‚Äôd forgive her. But then she would act the same way. Today I told her I was tired of her bs and that she could block me if she wants to, just stop texting me. I blocked her.

It felt awesome at the moment but now I feel like an asshole. I don‚Äôt regret it, but I never said anything similar to anyone. My heart was beating fast the whole time. Should I feel bad for telling the truth?

21303,"I'm sorry, but this is a long one. It's a bit of a weird story but I'm hoping that someone might be able to give me advice on what to do. Just over a month ago, I (female, cashier) got a new coworker (male, bagger) at the grocery store I work at. It took a while before we had a conversation together; he was helping me and asked me what kind of music I like. I was honest, and said that I like most genres and that I sometimes enjoyed listening to 20s and 30s jazz music. Then he just kept talking about old music at me for the next few days and seemed to always be distracted when it came to work. I don't like to talk much while I'm working because I feel like I mess up more when I do. So I began to feel anxious about being around him since I didn't know how to tell him I didn't want the conversation to continue every time we saw each other.

Then, a few days ago, he randomly asked me for my number in front of a bunch of customers while we were supposed to be working. I had a bad experience the last time I gave my number out to someone (the guy turned out to be a stalker who harassed me for weeks and told everyone that we were in a relationship when we weren't, wouldn't stop calling me, tried to turn me against my family, etc.) and I immediately felt freaked out about why this guy would want my number when we don't know each other at all. It felt really inappropriate and unprofessional to me. I told him that we were busy and shouldn't be having that conversation right then (mainly because I didn't know how to say no in the moment) and that we could talk when we were done helping customers. But he continued to ask me repeatedly for throughout the next hour or so. He ended up writing his number down at some point and gave it to me, telling me when he was off that day and to immediately text him my number when he was off (this is while I was talking to a customer). Once we were done with all of the customers, I told him the truth: that I didn't want to give him my number and how I had had bad experiences in the past that started with giving my number to a guy I barely knew. He seemed to understand and then avoided me the rest of the day. So I thought everything was going to be fine.

However, the next day, I started noticing that he seemed to be getting more clingy with me. He wouldn't be focused on doing his job and would stick around me as much as possible. He has a habit of sticking to my register instead of helping other cashiers like he's supposed to; he also seems to get bothered if another bagger is helping me and he tries to take over bagging for me immediately. I often notice him watching me from across the room. Every conversation we have is awkward. I don't initiate them because I want him to leave me alone so I can work. When he's not talking to me, it seems like he isn't really talking to our other coworkers that much.

But then, the other day, I had a bit of a scary experience. I was going on break and went to our break room. He was in there and had headphones in, so I didn't think he saw me. After a few minutes, I went to the bathroom across the hall. When I came out a few minutes later, the room was empty.  I suddenly hear loud footsteps running down the hall and he barges into the room, half-yelling my name just to show me a song from the 1800s for some reason. I'm worried that he might have been waiting outside the bathroom for me, which makes me kind of scared to be at work right now. I don't like being alone with him. Today, I spent the majority of my breaks hiding in the bathroom, worried he might bother me if I went anywhere else.

I know that the anxiety I feel isn't healthy, and I can't tell if I'm just paranoid from past experience or if there really could be a real issue here. I don't know if I should talk to him, a manager, or HR about this. I thought that maybe I should just say nothing and act less nice to him and see if he leaves me alone, but I'm worried that it could just make things worse. I could really use some advice if anyone has some. Because I really can't tell if he's just trying to be friendly and doesn't realize he's making me uncomfortable or if there is something potentially more creepy going on.",anxiety

I‚Äôve been having anxiety over PVCs, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm subconsciously guarding that side bc it‚Äôs near my heart. I know the vagus nerve is mostly afferent (takes info to the brain), and I‚Äôm wondering if the guarding could also be sending signals I‚Äôm not safe, thus increasing the anxiety I‚Äôm experiencing? Any ideas on stopping this other than increasing relaxation, and becoming more aware? Thanks in advance :)",anxiety

21591,"Whenever i have any ‚Äúevent‚Äù i get insane rising anxiety leading to it. Anything like public presentation, job interview, doctor appt, or even going to a friends house party or ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù (haha i rarely)

Days before ill start preparing , night before i can barely sleep. I can feel adrenaline increasing 24-48 hours. I get EXTREMELY alert.

The day of i wake up i cant eat anything. Cant even drink more than a few sips of water.

The hours leading up i begin HARD coughing and dry heaving. To the point ill damage my throat and it gets sore. I never actually throw up but this has been happening so long i just dont eat to be safe. Still i get uncontrollable gagging. Like i actually think i gave myself a hernia. Im talking violent gagging until i see stars, floaters and lights in my eyes, heart racing, chest muscles / stomach strained and hurting from the none stop gagging and heaving and coughing.

Then right when i walk into the ‚Äúevent‚Äù its all gone. 

Im still nervous but my mind tends to blank out and i disassociate a lot. This really fucks up technical job interviews because i totally blank out. A pure calm bliss blank state.

AFTER, i go home a complete weight is lifted off me. Im STARVING now. Extremely low anxiety, relaxed, rest state. Eating a ton because i probably have been eating 500-1000cals the last few days.

22158,"I don‚Äôt know why my brain is the way it is anymore and it hurts. I‚Äôm struggling so much. Here‚Äôs my story if you want to stick around to read it. Last year, about this same time I got Covid, probably the worst thing I have ever gone through in my entire life, besides the horrible sickness part, somehow it sparked some sort of new anxiety in me. Before it I never experienced anxiety like I do now, but somehow it came on painfully out of no where. Panic attacks more than once a day, unable to control my thoughts, horrible intrusive thoughts, nightmares, insomnia, constant fidgeting &amp; some anger/irritability for no reason at all. 
After a month or two from healing from Covid (Covid long haul) I was getting better, no more panic attacks, able to drive, get out and be happy. I was okay, till now. One night I woke up a little too early so I decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours, and boom it was back. My mind went straight back to the anxiety, the irritability and pain as before but without the anxiety.
It‚Äôs been a few weeks or so now since it started and I feel so tired and mentally drained.
I started some anxiety meds (Buspirone 5mg 2x) and haven‚Äôt seen a massive amount of change yet.

21967,"Hi Reddit. I am a young adult female in her first year of university, and I just wanted some reassurance or advice. 
I‚Äôve grown up around anxious people- having parents and step parents on anti depressants and with ptsd, so I know how the gist of mental health issues in this caliber (somewhat haha!). I myself have also struggled with mild anxiety or depression in the past, as well as a brief but somewhat severe ED many years ago, but nothing ever officially diagnosed or bad enough to get diagnosed or treated for a part from some counselling. However in the past few months my anxiety have been ramped up to the max, with the feeling of my heart pushing against my chest for the silliest little fears- giving me insomnia or making me feel sick etc. It‚Äôs doing as much as I write this.
One thing to note, I have a heart murmur, and occasionally I can notice it, but normally it‚Äôs very faint, if really there at all, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs got nothing to do with anything? 
I have been feeling kind of lonely lately. For some more recent context, whilst I play online with my old friends and see them and my bf often, I don‚Äôt have any really close friends at uni, and have had some fall outs with a Flatmate I share a bathroom with, making me often anxious in my own home. I absolutely love living away from home apart from this as I came from spilt custody between parents.
I would just like some advice or anyone with past experience to reassure or educate/help me if any way? Thank you so much :)",anxiety

21939,"Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here, and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!

I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May, wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever, I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life, mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine (anti depressants) for the last 2 years, this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.

Anyway, cutting to now... Since the very (very) start of the year, just after new years... (obviously) I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before, It was as though now I felt it full blast, and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else, and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this, I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing (he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft, believe me) so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it, as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way (although he's always telling me how perfect I am) It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...

fast forward a few days, I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection, or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to, if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me (even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before) after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional, may even start crying and it's difficult to stop, I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?

I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship, I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years, also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc, I also feel these emotions.

As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around, but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in, as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? (think that's the word) which would cause more anxiety for me, my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling, even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat (I'm feeling this pretty much everyday)

the past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as ""I don't love you"" and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real, having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else, this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections, where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way, is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.

I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship (a month or so) with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.

I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in, but this is just the summary of it...

Please can I get real responses with this, I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now.",anxiety

22077,"I'm 21 years old and I don't have my liscence. I've taken the road test three times in the past year, the last time I took it was on Thursday of last week. I bombed. Hard. I made sure I knew everything and what to do, I'm decent for a new driver, I know how to do a three point turn and my parallel parking is great, I drive as much as possible with my mom and I made sure I was extremely prepared. However when I got in the car for the test I was panicking the whole time. I failed almost everything and everything in my brain got jumbled up. (I'm not diagnosed with anxiety, never seen a psychiatrist or been on meds or anything, not how my family is, but I am a deeply deeply anxious person) I don't know how to get past this. My next test is in a couple weeks and I know I'm prepared and can drive and having my liscence would make my life so much easier but I'm so worried I'm never going to get it because of how anxious I get on the test. I just want to know if this is a shared experience and if anyone has any advice or anything. :(",anxiety

21918,"Hello, I'm mason and As of lately  since the start of grade 11. We where told we basically had to choose are pathway as in our job, or related field anyways as of late I wanted to follow in my uncles path and become a personal investor, and since he's already high up I'd have a job lined up for me as i get outta high school and more, the only catch. "" I knew i had anxiety but ever since i choose what I wanted to do math is now associated with anxiety"" to make it worse I was labeled a troubled kid when i was younger in life so as a result we moved a lot, and I never had a long friendship making me easy targets for people who love drama. So as i was growing I was taking speical classes since I had bad adhd aswell, so I wasn't getting the right credited for really anything in life and was basically  labelled a special needs since they never put time into me. as a result i started trying better and Finally was able to upgrade to college level everything in grade 10 keep and keep in mind I was in high school in grade 8 due to this special program, and now they they teach me like any other kid. I've found it very hard to do anything since i grew up getting 1-1 attention, now since High school math is broken and 50% u will most likely never use in real life depending  on the career  you pick although the one i wanted to get into was ""money related"" I most diffidently don't need trig, etc anyways     "" I really need help finding out how to coop with anxiety, this only happens during math aswell, So i know the trigger, and i know hen i clam myself down and I'm very happy before math i do better during math. but for some reason anytime my teacher ignores me for example today "" I rasied my hand to kep my practice quiz checked nobody else had their hand up"" so i wait she see's says one second and goes to 5 different people none of them had their hands out and forgot that i eveen asked so i promptly left teh class and went outside to get air or i was gonna start crying for the stress, angry anxiety and everything why are my emotions 10x whenever i'm in math  is their even any way to fix this issue?""",anxiety

21359,"This is probably a very particular issue and I‚Äôve never really wanted to post about my anxiety but I‚Äôve led myself here anyway. After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago, things have been pretty hellish for me. I‚Äôve got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day (anxiety, of course), every day.  Now, I love love LOVE films. I plan to go to college next year and study film. I‚Äôve wanted to become a director for years now. As you‚Äôd imagine, that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film, whenever. But, going to the cinema, something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love, a place I would go to escape, has become really difficult for me. I really struggle in the days leading up to going, takes serious mental preparation. I‚Äôve been a total of 6 times in 2023, which to people who know me, is simply unheard of. I‚Äôm a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow. I‚Äôve been waiting a long time to see it, but I just can‚Äôt see myself actually going out and seeing it. If you‚Äôre aware of the John Wick films, you know that they‚Äôre probably the most ‚Äúfoot on the gas‚Äù and brutal action films around. Which I feel is going to really freak me out. In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety, I‚Äôve never had to leave the cinema. I‚Äôm pretty uncomfortable being there but I‚Äôve never had to leave. I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me, despite me having no evidence to support it. While I‚Äôve been able to push myself to go all the other times, I just can‚Äôt see it happening this time. I know it‚Äôs a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

21425,"I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I don't feel anxious anymore, and it's a vicious cycle. And so, please, telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesn't help to say this to me now.

Recently, I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night. This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I don't remember or if I blackout.

After a recent night out, I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with (im new to the job). There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember.  I asked, and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting, but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again.

However, I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night. Just like I'm always convinced I did something bad the previous time. That I maybe told them I want to rape/hurt/abuse someone, or that I was racist towards someone, or that I said a secret. And even if they said that it was absolutely fine, I'm convinced that they are hiding something from me, that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me. That they are all laughing/talking behind my back. I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen, so much, that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid.

This is not a new thing in my life, I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done, if there's a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me. 

The same happens in my sober life. I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us. Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go. One day I raped someone, the next I have cancer. One day I pissed someone off, the next day the past is coming to get me. I'm terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic.

If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat. I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink.",anxiety

I have thoughts that I'm not being productive and that there arent many things I could do to be productive.  This is what concerns me most. 
I'm doing a degree and that's the only productive thing I'm doing. I feel trapped in a boring lifestyle and i'm also living with my parents.. I've contemplated moving back to Australia, but then I would have to go on a job hunt .. it's still an option.",anxiety

21813,"long story short:

for a better understanding, i harmed my body and soul so many times because of untreaded trauma ( i think), i drink booze on the weekends since my 18th birthday, and later some party drugs came in.

if i would have a glimpse of which pain i will live through back in the days i would have never touched any drug.

i had so many breakdowns in the last 3 years and it feels like i will never be the person again i was.

with the booze and the drugs came panic attacks and anxiety disorders.

i am not the same anymore and dont know if this ever will pass.

i feel miserable, no energy, cant laugh anymore, its like being buried alive.

21213,"Every single day I feel the life inside of me just fall down as if it were sand, every day I feel like I can't breathe, I just sit and look around because even though no one sees it, I feel like my lings are vomiting inside me.

Every single day I want to kill myself while at the same time having a panic attack because I don't want to die.

And then I just sit there, not bothering anyone, because no one can look at me and tell me my intestines are silently spinning, no one can look at me and see my heart beating way too fast and know I'm not breathing.

And certainly no one knows that every fucking day while I try to live my life I see myself in a grave not feeling any physical sensation at all, its almost as if I can see the future, almost as if old me is sitting in bed slowly rotting away, dead and no one has checked up on me for several hours

Why tf am I like this, I'm 14, I'm supposed to enjoy life but insead I hate this shit, and I hate living with this terrible anxiety about nothing and everything at the same time, not living because I don't wanna die, which makes me want to kill myself

The worst part is I'm not even diagnosed with an anxiety disorder because I'm too scared to talk to anyone about it, and so no one will ever know, because I don't know people well enough to tell them this. I guess I don't mind sharing with strangers online tho

I woke up and started completing my typically morning routine, all was well. I came to the end of the list of things I have to do in my head. I left very sick to my stomach. I‚Äôve been trying to become more aware of my anxiety symptoms and have noticed they often show as tummy issues. Typically physical, both feeling like I need to vomit and poop my pants. I ran to the bathroom and vomited. I had to reach out to my boss and explain the situation. I woke with children. I was also informed and asked about my colleague, whom I work with directly, they were possibly going to be out for the day as well causing a staffing issue. 
I feel guilty and a lot of other emotions about the situation. It feels like I let my team down. I also have a tendency to think and help others without thinking about  myself in the process. The ultimate people pleaser. I was just hoping someone out there in the universe experiences anything similar to me. If so I appreciate you, Thank you for taking the time to read üíó I‚Äôd love to chat ü•∞",anxiety

21279,"So the preface, I‚Äôm someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years, occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dad‚Äôs door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills, taxes, or myself, that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they can‚Äôt stop themselves, but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene, my mom did physically attack  me (I didn‚Äôt get hurt, I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me).

Last night, she called me to ask if I could knock on my dad‚Äôs door, since he wasn‚Äôt responding to her calls, because she ‚Äúneeded to pay a bill.‚Äù I knew that this wasn‚Äôt just about a bill, so I compromised and sent him a text instead, I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasn‚Äôt going to call him/wake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency, as I would consider it to be rude to do so. 

She then says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry your little head about, go back to sleep or whatever, okay?‚Äù 

Then, she called me again, this time saying ‚ÄúWhat are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door.‚Äù I declined, saying I don‚Äôt want to be a part of whatever was going on between them, and she should talk to him about this, to which she said ‚ÄúI know. He‚Äôs your loving dad, and I‚Äôm the evil mom.‚Äù 

I said goodnight to her, she laughs and responded with ‚Äúnot goodnight. Good bye.‚Äù 

I say that I will talk to her tomorrow, and she replies ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never talk to you again. Not tomorrow, not the next day, or the next.‚Äù

She then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. 

She calls me one more time that night, here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door again:

‚ÄúI ask you to do one simple thing, and you didn‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad, and he isn‚Äôt answering me. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre picking sides or anything! Translation: ‚ÄúLook at what I do for you! And yet, you can‚Äôt this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre picking sides or anything!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of shit, just like him (my dad).‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere has your dad been all of your life?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to take responsibility.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this what one of your councilors told you to say, the one that I pay [x amount of money, I don‚Äôt exactly remember].‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even know what is going on.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut fine. You can do whatever- go to sleep, wake up in the morning, do whatever you do.‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúok. Goodnight, mom.‚Äù

And finally, I said goodnight to her, and she said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me mom. Just say good night.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not to say my dads innocent either or anything - he‚Äôs hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well, so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically, they‚Äôre both each others abusers and victims, if that makes any sense at all. 

But I do believe he is the safer parent, as although he can, at his worst, make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him, as he is kind of an asshole at times, I don‚Äôt feel like my safety is threatened around him, unlike with my mom. He‚Äôs a lesser of two evils , if you will.

So I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad, and my mom immediately associated me with him. So, now I‚Äôm afraid that when she comes home, she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad, or worse. I‚Äôm afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. 

Okay that is all, I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.",anxiety

I loved it when I had no job, I never had to worry about putting on a mask for customers and coworkers or the responsibilities that come with a job. I hate the long hours because I can feel myself slowly breaking down inside. And when I get back home my anxiety goes through the roof for when I gotta work next. Even if I got days off, I‚Äôm so so so freaking worried that they‚Äôll call me to come in when I‚Äôm not mentally prepared. I got to have time to psych myself up for work.

21460,"Hello.

For about a year, I've been having these obsessive thoughts about the past, all the ways I've messed up and things I did wrong. It's kinda ridiculous; I worry about things that happened 10 od so years ago, and I was just a kid back then, only about 12. I think about newer things too, but especially back then, I was cringy and mean to others for no reason (I didn't like the band that they did. I never bullied them, but I would kinda laugh at them and point out that they're being pandered to. Now I would just turn away and ignore them, I don't know what was up with me back then. To my defense I was almost always the youngest of the group, surrounded by people who were 14-16, from both sides). 

I feel like I'm a terrible human being and that I will be punished for them any day now; I don't know how exactly, by some external force that will come from outside of my home. I'm afraid that people who know me now and are my friends or people I'll meet in the future will judge me so hard and turn away from me. I've deleted every old social media account I could remember, I still make sure that my old emails are active so that I could delete any more if I'll remember. I'm on pretty heavy medications (antidepressants, three doses of synthetic pregabalin and an antipsychotic to quell my anxiety further), and I can function well, but these thoughts still come to me randomly and make me anxious. 

I don't know what to do anymore; My biggest wish is to just move on from that period of my life and close this chapter. On one hand, if someone came to me with thoughts like these, I would tell them that it was so long ago, and they have likely very little to do with the person they were at 13; Besides, everyone was a bit of a little shit at that age. But for some reason, when it comes to me, I just can't free myself; When I get scared, I feel like an ensnared wikd animal, only the snare is just in my head.

Tests that I have done and that came back normal : Adrenaline Heart test , Echocardiagram, Blood test (D-dimer included) , Chest X-Ray and soon i'm getting a 24 hour EKG. I've also tested my lung capacity by blowing into a tube. But nothing came  back abnormal. 

I don't know if I should get any other tests but it is worth noting that I suspect I got covid-19 and apparently some people experience these problems aswell.

21238,"I know it‚Äôs contradictory but yeah. Not sure if this has to do with being a perfectionist or if it‚Äôs something else.

And I ended up shaking and crying while changing my clothes and getting ready for the evening. And then I just gave up. It sucks, I really wanted to go, the event sounded like a blast and I already bought the ticket. It all came crashing down when I realised that I don't know anyone from the event and that I had to make the effort of meeting new people there alone. I thought I could be brave and go to that place alone because none of my friends didn't want to come with me.

hi loves &lt;33.

21350,"Disclaimer, the post is slightly copy paste from this thread but I want to share this on many threads in order to get some help.   


I'm M 33years old:

[What's really interesting is, every single described on this thread are almost identical to the ones I I have right now, so if you can please check them out so you understand what I am going trough.](https://www.reddit.com/r/costochondritis/comments/jrihv6/chest_pain_for_months_no_answers/?xpromo_edp=enabled)   


The only logical explanation I've found myself is, that it might be severe Anxiety or Burnout I've experienced which makes my muscles being tense up all the time without me even realising it and get inflamed by the constant stress.

As well some people, from what I've googled, claim that it might be side effect after a COVID infection (around June 2022), but oddly enough my wife is totally fine despite both of us having similar symptoms while we were sick (I got headaches and my throat hurt, her throat hurt and she was tired, both of us were 3x vaccinated). The only reason why I rule it out, is because these pains did start 2 days after my bed broke down while I was lying on it (August 2022) and we changed the bed mattress afterwards around october 2022 but we've slept on the couch (that can be transformed into a bed) which is literally a wooden plank with the old mattress on top of it that was way overdue (had a ""hole"" in the middle so had to change it) for almost 3 months.

Before this all happend, I was really really stressed for years because of tons of private issue that negatively impacted my mental health and I was inactive during the lock down (2020) and after losing my job (june 2021), I've been almost every day on the PC (with bad posture probably) from 2019 - June 2022. (I got now a new job in september 2022 but got laid off from a previous one I was in for 3 months around January 2022)

Also I was on Amitriptyline 25mg for almost a year, and stopped taking them as my neurologist told me back than (June 2022), I used to have around 2021 iirc similar pains/tingles on the left side of my body but not like the ones I have right now.

I do really hope if anyone finds out what we can do do finally feel better, beside accepting our symptoms and live with them.  


I have the typical tingly, electric feelings around my left side, headaches, migraines, heart races, burning/cold feeling on one foot or both etc these symptoms typical come when I feel really anxious.  


Now all the symptoms seems to focus on Chest/Pain/Neck Pain with Brain Fog with, especially when the pains are strong.

  
The only relief I've found was lying down (tough sometimes I had moment where my back was blocked/stiffed but just for a short time and after I moved a bit), taking walks outside in the fresh air, being distracted, doing some stretching of the muscle where I have the pain.  


Yet what I hate is they all return.  
I've did the classic health anxiety attack routine going to many Doctors, ER etc:  
dozens of Bloodtest came fine, have a slight Arthrosis and disc misplacement on my neck (nothing seriously according to the doctors), Neurologe didn't found any anomaly, Cardio doctor in August/September 2022 told me my heart is totally fine (we did a stress test on a bike)   


So in the end, I really hope it's just my anxiety/burnout, as my doctors all say, who gave me all these physical symptoms. All I want is that these pains finally stop! And if I did write many confusing things, please tell me so I can clear it up.  


P.S. I wanted to add as well that I grew up with stress my whole life ever since my childhood and that even to this day, I am really nervous and my fingers are always tremble, I am now asking myself if my body decided to crack when I got into my 30s",anxiety

21226,"I am currently under an intense care plan as an outpatient at a mental health hospital. One of the nurses suggested asking for an extra amount of allowance. 'well off' (but not rich) parents completely fund me while I'm at university as my loan is less than my rent.

I was debating asking for weeks, me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least, some definitely their fault, some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway, it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.

But last night I asked them, told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion, they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY. It's sending my anxiety haywire this is why I don't open up or ask anything from my parents.

What do I do? Say no to them visiting all together? I'm 100% fine with keeping the current allowance, I just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.

21827,"Hi, I'm Peter, 20. Recently I've been thinking of bad things happening base on my intuition. Most of these bad things are related to my relationship with the people around me. I'm constantly thinking that they have something against me or they're betraying me. This started last year, 2022 after the restriction, because of the pandemic, loosened. I had a group of friends that I was with  and had a few drinks together, had fun, and typical stuff you do with your friends. After a fee months, I felt something was wrong. Even though they are not showing it, I feel it that they don't like me. I confronted them about it, and they said ""no"". But few days after that, someone told me what they've been saying about me. I felt betrayed and sad. After that unfortunate incident, I've been having trust issues and I trust my intuition more than ever. 

Now, I'm talking to someone. He's sweet and gentle. He works hard and is independent. He talks to me even though he's tired, I really feel that he's someone to keep. But today, I just felt that something's wrong. He called me but he didn't speak. I called him back but didn't answer. I texted him what's wrong, if he's okay. He answered me ""yupp"". That was it, not even an explanation. I don't know if I should tell this guy that what he did triggered my anxiety, and I suddenly felt that he's unto something. I don't want to think much about it because I actually like him. 

Should I tell him after his shift or I should keep it to myself and see what the future holds for me?",anxiety

21665,"Hey guys,

so one of my anxiety symptoms that sometimes happens is that large parts of my body just go completely numb, mostly my arms, legs, chest, neck and face.

Right now it's happening again and even though i know that it's most likely just my anxiety, my brain knows that numb = nerve problem, and that's what i can't get out of my head :/

I am so worried that one day i actually do have something with my nerves, but i ignore it thinking it's just anxiety and then i stay permanently numb because i didn't go see a doctor....

And what if one day i have a stroke and just try to ignore it because ""oooh anxiety""

How am i supposed to know the difference between my brain tricking me and an actual emergency??

I'm trying to calm down, but i keep touching my numb parts to feel if they are still numb :(",anxiety
21458,"
I have HA and one of my worst fears came true. My bf found out he has a rare genetic disorder that has a 50% chance to be inherited. 

We're commited and planning kids in the future. I freak out over a fuckin cough and this is driving me crazy. 

For me, the worst part is that my boyfriend is an absolute flegmatic and works on ""don't think about what you can't solve"" approach. I almost broke down when he brought the results home and he was just like... ""We'll see what to do when it happens, it's not like there's something we can do about it"" and then I saw in the report that they offered him an assisted reproduction option when we'll want kids and asked him if he'll want to go down that route and he said ""Dunno"" and it was obvious that he's not too excited about it"". But, like, how can you even THINK about risking 50% chance of it being inherited by our child??? It drives me absolutely bonkers. Why would you even be willing to RISK it when there is way safe option that is not that natural but would ensure that we'll have a thriving, healthy baby? And especially when the other alternative is pretty miserable, both physically and mentally?

We've been together for years and at this point I know him. I know he only seems to not care because he has a hard time explaining and showing his emotions. I also know I am being terribly, terribly unfair towards him for feeling frustrated at him. He just found out something so crucial! He needs time and space to deal with it and he needs my support. Instead I am the one demanding emotional support from him (I am demanding it only here don't worry, I don't plan to freak out on him while he's going through this). I don't understand why I am being so selfish when usually I put others first automatically.

But most stress inducing thing about it is, he mentioned some of my health issues to the genetic center and now they want to see me too because they have ""a small suspicion"" that there might be something from my side too. Of course, I googled the signs of what he has and, well, I am not surprised they want to see me, I check all the boxes, even skeletal malformation.

What's keeping me sane is the knowledge that the disorder is incredibly rare and that neither of my siblings show any (obvious) signs of it. That in itself should logically be enough to reassure me that I am FINE, but my brain refuses to accept it. I feel like someone took me, stuffed me into a washing machine and turned on a turbo wash. And I want to scream. 

AAAAAAAAAA

21842,"I‚Äôve had anxiety for years, since I was very young, I remember being afraid of everything and having phobias of germs, getting sick, heights, flying, driving, certain foods, etc. I was constantly scared as a child and eventually as I went off to college when I was 16 I slowly learned to live with my anxiety. I tried new things, I slowly came out of my shell. When I hit 34.. everything came to a head, I had gone through a major divorce at 33, lived through COVID under constant fear, I was diagnosed with PCOS, was moving across the country in May and was the heaviest I had ever been May 2022. By August 2022 I had lost 70lbs in almost two months because I was so afraid to eat I was basically crying every single day. I couldn‚Äôt eat and refused to, my emetophobia was so strong I could barely move everyday. I was in the ER multiple times, having procedures and CT scans done and no one could find out what was wrong with me. 

It was then that I finally decided that I needed medication, I talked to a psychiatrist for the first time. I felt like a failure, I had been through so much but I couldn‚Äôt break this fear and horror of food. Therapy wasn‚Äôt helping and I had been so afraid of food that no one could get me to eat more than a bite or two for a whole day. I was prescribed medication because one of its side effects was to rise my appetite, and at first it didn‚Äôt work. I felt again, so defeated and exhausted. They put me on a higher dose.. and after a few weeks, I felt hungry. I had cravings again. I felt like finally eating and I was so famished, I finally ate a piece of pizza because the cheese looked so good I couldn‚Äôt not eat it.

September 2022 I decided to start going to the gym, I was scared at first, I only would go in for 20 minutes 3 times a week. I was so weak, I had lost all my muscle starving myself. 

October 2022 I went to the gym for the first time for an hour. I went up to the free weights and was discouraged, but then watched some YouTube videos and started building workouts. I walked my first mile without pain. I was eating 1,800 calories a day. I wasn‚Äôt as afraid. 

November 2022 I ate out at a restaurant for the first time in months! I had nachos and they were delicious. I wasn‚Äôt afraid! I had my colonoscopy and they found IBS and colitis. I finally had answers to my stomach pains. 

December 2022 I made a big Christmas dinner with my partner and roommate and I ate a full meal! I was now lifting at the gym 5 times a week. 

January 2023 I travelled out of the state on a plane! I ate out almost everyday! I enrolled back into school for my masters. 

February 2023 to now: I workout 5 days a week and I walk 2-3 miles every single day. I keep my body on a routine for my chronic illnesses and I eat a focused healthy diet everyday.

Some days are still hard, some days have anxiety.. some days my stomach hurts and I have flare ups randomly. But every bad day has five times better ones. I focus on the positive, I try not to be afraid of anything anymore. And even if I am? I remember it can‚Äôt hurt me, and I‚Äôll be okay tomorrow. 

I wish everyone the best of luck in your journey and recovery üíú",anxiety

21381,"I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders?  

I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a ""money induced paralysis"". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/v4qq6k/discussion_lack_of_motivation_induced_by_lack_of/) thread.  

It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort.  

I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind.  

I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?",anxiety

So today in lab, my friend was getting frustrated because she was hungry from not eating all day. And when lab was over, I kind of rushed out because I felt a panic attack going on. I went to the bathroom to put cold water on my face. She got angry at me, texting me saying ‚Äúwhere the fuck are you?‚Äù And when she found me she sat there with a look on her face. I told her she can go to the dining hall but instead she went back to the lab classroom and started to talk shit about me to our lab partner.

21325,"I (26 M) am super frustrated with myself, today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux. The cardiologist did some blood pressure/pulse checks to rule out POTS and said I was fine on that front. The EKG came back great and he said my heart was in excellent shape. I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great. Now as I get home from the doctor my anxious brain gets to plotting and is now worrying that ""He didn't order you another echocardiogram what if he's missing something"". My rational brain believes and trusts this doctor very much, but the anxiety part of my brain just wants to create more worry for any reason it can find. Can anyone give me some advice or insight? Is there even any Medical reason I would need a second echocardiogram 1 year later? I assume it detects defects that have been there probably from birth so a second one is probably pointless but it's hard to tell my anxious brain that. I Just want to believe the doctors when they give me positive news and believe that I'm fine.

21884,"Over the last 2 weeks my (30M) Anxiety had gotten worse to the point of finding it difficult to sleep, no appetite, tight chest, can't focus on work and upset stomach. My doctor proscribed me some very low dose xanax for 10 days and also some other anxiety meds that take around 2 weeks to start working. I'm hesitant to take any of it though, I don't want to feel dependent on meds and then when i stop taking them, the anxiety comes back.

My long term girlfriend and I broke up earlier in 2022, but we would sometimes keep in touch and see each occasionally. We went to college together, but didnt date in college, so alot of her friends are my friends also. She moved 6 hrs away for a job before we broke up and that was part of why we broke up, along with other things. It was easy being with her from the friends aspect but deep down inside there were some things that really bothered me about our relationship. We always tried to make it work but it just didn't. She ended things with me, but we are on good terms.

She recently told me that she is seeing someone, and ever since then it has bothered the hell out of me and have had all this anxiety since. Its making me think did I make the right decision in pretty much agreeing to break up, to the point we spoke on the phone and she said, sorry but it's over between us.

I have gotten anxiety bouts before but its always about job deadlines or things that once over the anxiety goes away. This is different, I know my relationship with her in a romantic way is over, and the severity of this anxiety is much worse than anything I have felt. before.

Examples 
7-years ago my bf(now husband) and I bought a dog. I cried and cried the first night we got him because i was soo scared of having totake care of anything else besides me. A few weeks later, the anxiety disappeared. I absolutely love my dog.
7-years ago i left my first job after being there for 5 years. I cried and cried. Had so much anxiety leading up to the new interview. Had ssoo much anxiety after being told i was hired. I was terrified of failing, not being able to pay my bills. So much so, that i asked for my job back. But was ghosted because they were upset i had quit in the first place. 7 years later still at this (new)job, its consistent, i make money. I feel secure. And glad i left the place prior.
3years ago i got engaged but wasn‚Äôt anxious about anything. Because we halted planning a wedding to buy a house
2 years ago my fianc√© and i bought a house. It was fun leading up to the week before closing. The day before i was crying, anxious, scared. I felt like iwas making a mistake. What if we lose the house? What if something happens and we cant afford it because we have a mortgage now. I was fine after a couple days. Im sssoo happy in my home.
8 months ago, i got married. For the 3/4 months leading up to the wedding, i had horrible anxiety. Every single night id have lingering anxiety, some nights better than others, but always there. 
The week before the wedding i was a mess, scared of being married, scared of the change. But i am ssoo in love with my fianc√©, he is my everything. I couldn‚Äôt understand the anxiety because i was happy! The day of the wedding i was emotion filled, i couldnt talk to anyone while getting ready, i was a nervous wreck. Once we left the church i felt ssooo different! I was actually FEELING how i felt. Happy, excited, in love. Not anxious. The reception was amazing! Im soo happy!

Now-im 29, husband is 30. We are talking about kids. I want them, but im sssooo afraid of the anxiety i know ill have. Im scared of the pregnancy, what if i have a difficult time, what if im anxious like i was for the wedding for all 9months? Im soo scared of giving birth, of the potential postpartum depression, me not connecting. Or what if i dont connect with baby? Idk im already anxious thinking about having an approximate date to get off birth control. Im scared. I brought up adoption but i hate the fact that id rather chose adoption JUST because of the anxiety. I know ill deal with it when the time comes closer to adopt. But it wont be 9months. 
Why does my body do this to me. I hate my anxiety.

21957,"I have been struggling with worse anxiety for the past year and recently, my anxiety does NOT let me believe that my boyfriend loves me. He gives me reassurance everytime I ask, but for some reason it is never enough. For instance, when he says why he does, my thoughts will find complaints with his reasons why. 

I haven't talked to him about this because this is technically not a his issue and I hate burdening others with my anxiety. He has reassured me everyday and I don't want to ask for more. I feel like this is something I need to figure out on my own. 

I've had bad experiences with boys in general, so I often time believe that they will say whatever is convenient to them. so I cannot shake this feeling and I do not know what to do. 

Ive been talking to a therapist but she has not been giving me effective solutions. She listens and validates, but I need calming techniques... 

How do I shake this feeling? what should i do?",anxiety

The calls sometimes start at 7:00AM and don‚Äôt end until after 6:00 other days.  And heavy traffic back home.

Every week this year it seems something around the house is breaking and either needing me to repair it or pay someone to come out.

After sorting out the to-do list time is passed with my dogs, who I love very much but are extremely pushy and needy some days.

That goes on until my father-in-law gets home and demands that the dogs get put away, and everything turned off and focus turned to him so he can tell all about whatever‚Äôs on his mind ‚Äî he lives with us. And if I don‚Äôt drop everything I have to hear from his family and somehow my family about how I need to stop hurting his feelings.

21208,"i‚Äôm a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma, mom, uncle, aunt, and little sister.

my mom has a meth addiction and she‚Äôs developed schizophrenia from it and it‚Äôs been getting worse as the years go on. my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think it‚Äôs schizophrenia. my mom doesn‚Äôt take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so (realistically she‚Äôs been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out) recently my mom moved back in like a week ago. my uncle is very strange and i don‚Äôt know really anything about him. he leaves his room a few times a day and doesn‚Äôt talk to anyone, sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room, but he doesn‚Äôt yell and scream like my mom does, he‚Äôs just very quiet and intense. 

so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead, and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because i‚Äôve seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how  she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how she‚Äôs constantly was thinking about me and she doesn‚Äôt think i‚Äôm safe. so i looked and my aunt (she‚Äôs mentally well) sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me. 

the message said ‚Äú*uncles name* is acting strange again. i asked *moms name* if she did this and she said she didn‚Äôt. does *uncles name* know what it means to stab someone? that they will die?‚Äù in the photo my aunt sent my grandma, the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade. the thing is i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it, so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didn‚Äôt really freak out. but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea it‚Äôs probably not safe. 

i don‚Äôt know if it was my uncle or mom either though, if it even was intentional. my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot, and we would yell and scream at each other (we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen, then we moved, then we moved again and he moved back in with us) but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all. he‚Äôs very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet, and i can tell he doesn‚Äôt like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever. we‚Äôve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and that‚Äôs about it. he does kinda seem like he hates me but i don‚Äôt think he would want to kill me. on the other hand it‚Äôs possible that my mom was lying to my aunt, but from what i‚Äôve seen i don‚Äôt think my mom wants to kill me either. whenever she has talked about me in that way it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúthis is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him‚Äù type of way rather than a malicious tone. but again, they are both schizophrenic which i really don‚Äôt know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm asking. 

i know it‚Äôs weird to ask about this on reddit but i really don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it. i‚Äôm not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and he‚Äôs a big guy i just don‚Äôt want to i feel like it‚Äôd be worse, and i don‚Äôt want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did. i‚Äôm going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i haven‚Äôt been able to since she‚Äôs been asleep all night, but she‚Äôs just going to ignore me after i express my concerns, which she always does. i can talk to my aunt about it even though we‚Äôre not really too close but yeah. 

another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it, didn‚Äôt deny it so. but yea i cant really move out or anything, i don‚Äôt have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i don‚Äôt have a job right now since i‚Äôm a full time student and i just don‚Äôt know where i would go. i don‚Äôt have any friends that would let me live with them either so that‚Äôs out of the picture . the best thing i‚Äôm hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but that‚Äôll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad. i just don‚Äôt know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldn‚Äôt be worried or what i should do so yea pls help",anxiety

21664,"I need help/insight 

I started my first this job September of my last semester of college, and I was excited to have such a great opportunity. 

From day one, I have felt very little direction at the job. I had one day of training on one of the four projects I was to oversee. The previous person in the position had left already and I was trained by someone filling in for the moment. The training I got doesn‚Äôt even scratch the surface of all that I have to do. There‚Äôs so many things don‚Äôt know how to do or didn‚Äôt know I was supposed to do. I‚Äôve read through my manual for help and there‚Äôs not enough information. 

It seems me asking for help from my colleagues is unwanted, and something is not clear between me and my bosses. It‚Äôs like the expect me to know things I was never shown. I‚Äôve only been trying to learn the system for 7 months (which I do understand better now). 

I feel trapped and punished. I don‚Äôt reach out, then will always be lost. I reach out and it‚Äôs a surprise. 

This my first ‚Äúlegitimate job‚Äù and I can‚Äôt tell whether or not I‚Äôm not good enough or if I was put in a bad situation. I want to like my job, but I honestly really dislike it due to never knowing completely what I‚Äôm doing. I have no help‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm on edge everyday thinking about my job.",anxiety

22063,"About a month ago I (F 25) had (what I think) was a panic attack. I‚Äôve gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood (family member has tired to take their life a few times) but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 11/12 and have only opened up about 90% with my long term boyfriend.

In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasn‚Äôt worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didn‚Äôt talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasn‚Äôt an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just don‚Äôt understand why didn‚Äôt snap out of it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training (ironically) and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment came rushing back. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn‚Äôt keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I‚Äôm not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don‚Äôt normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn‚Äôt even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he‚Äôs not worried about me dying then maybe I‚Äôm not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‚Äòa little bit of anxiety‚Äô. 

Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then I‚Äôve had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to happen in public and now I‚Äôm being referred to therapy so I‚Äôm not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless. Sorry for the long post.",anxiety

im always convinced that something bad will happen to me or my pets while im sleeping, or that i'll go to sleep and not wake up in the morning (which not too long ago i would've been completely fine with). i havent had a good nights sleep in almost 2 months now. im so exhausted. it feels like i find something new to worry about almost every day, and those anxious thoughts are always the loudest at night.

21724,"Hello - this is a short story that at least for me, it was a great anxiety relief. If you like it, I will post more. 

Once upon a time in a serene village, nestled within a lush green valley, there lived a gentle, wise elephant named Elara. This village was known for its tranquility, as it was graced with a unique energy that seemed to ease the worries and stresses of all who lived there.

One day, a young girl named Mia came to the village, seeking relief from her overwhelming anxiety. Upon hearing about Elara's wisdom, she ventured to the peaceful grove where the elephant resided. The moment Mia approached, she felt her heart rate slowing and her breath deepening.

""Elara, I've heard of your wisdom and calming presence. Please, can you help me with my anxiety?"" Mia asked timidly.

Elara looked at her with gentle eyes and replied, ""Of course, dear child. Sit down beside me, and let me share with you the secret to finding peace within yourself.""

As Mia settled down, Elara began to tell her a story.

""Long ago, our village was visited by a wise old monk. He too had experienced the tranquility of our valley and wished to uncover the source of this peaceful energy. He spent many days meditating under the ancient oak tree at the center of the village. Finally, he discovered the secret: within each of us exists a tiny, peaceful oasis, an inner sanctuary that remains untouched by the chaos of the world.""

The wise elephant continued, ""To access this sanctuary, you must learn to quiet your mind and listen to the rhythm of your own breath. Begin by taking slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. With each breath, imagine your worries dissolving into the wind, leaving only peace and tranquility behind.""

Mia closed her eyes and followed Elara's guidance. As she inhaled and exhaled, she felt her anxiety ebbing away, replaced with a sense of calm and safety she had never known before.

After some time, Mia opened her eyes and looked at the wise elephant. ""Thank you, Elara. Your words have brought me peace, and I will carry this lesson with me wherever I go.""

As Mia prepared to leave, Elara touched her trunk gently to the girl's shoulder. ""Remember, dear child, your inner sanctuary is always within you. Whenever you feel overwhelmed or anxious, simply close your eyes, breathe deeply, and allow yourself to find refuge in the peaceful oasis of your heart.""

With newfound strength and a heart filled with gratitude, Mia returned to her life, carrying the wisdom of Elara and the tranquility of the village with her. She had discovered the power of her inner sanctuary, and now, she was ready to face the world with courage and serenity.",anxiety

21224,"I have hurry sickness and it's linked to my anxiety and BPD. It causes me so much anxiety because I always feel like I need to do many things at the same time or short period of time.   
I drink my coffee in about 5 minutes, then I read a book for an hour, then I listen to music and surf the web for a non-specific reason. Everything has to be done very fast, and well-planned, if not, I get impatient, irritable, and anxious.   
It's pretty exhausting and I realized it's a problem going on for two years now. I did not pay too much attention to this before, since I didn't even know there was a term for this condition.

21938,"Hi guys,

I've experienced anxiety for a long time now (26F), I'd say at least 8 years. Symptoms have always been tight chest, heart going a million miles an hour, the occasional panic attack. 

I've always managed it quite well, have a decent job and can interact with people fairly well. 

I've never let it stop me doing anything as then I'd feel like it has beat me.

As of 3 weeks ago (it was literally one day fine and the next.. NOT FINE!), I got on the train to go to work and felt like I was going to throw up. My mouth was watering and heart felt like it was in my throat. At first I thought it was food poisoning and something was physically amiss. 

Even though I haven't thrown up and logic would indicate I'm not going to, it feels like I genuinely am on the verge everytime I am in a moving vehicle. 

I thought it would pass, but it's now just part of my everyday life and I'm finding it debilitating. I'm scared I'll lose my job because of it, which is feeding into the anxiety even more. The only way I can get through a train journey (or any moving vehicle for that matter) is by closing my eyes and putting on Bob Marley through my headphones. It's quite comedic but it genuinely is the only way I can slightly manage it. 

I've never enjoyed the commute and have done it for ages, but now it's became a THING. 

I have to have a plastic bag with me at all times as the urge to throw up is so real. 

Has anyone else experienced a sudden and drastic change in anxiety symptoms, how do you manage them? I'm scared I'll be this way forever.",anxiety

Im 26 and started driving since 16

I had a serious work injury over 3 years ago that resulted in my fingers being amputated in the hospital.

I do not drive as frequently at all before

But 2 years mark I notice that I became a little tensed up, anxious while driving

Up to NOW I shake while driving and it only happens when I drive and if it gets bad enough I‚Äôll kinda feel like imma pass out but never have (Thank God)

This is absolutely defeating and horrible for me as I used to drive heavy duty class vehicles w/ big trailers everyday, even heavy equipment.

I use to drive to the ends of the earth and back when I used to work so this is just completely unreal to me how I feel now

Cant even drive my boat with my dad on the lake (although its not as bad as driving on the road)


Now I cant even make it to the store without taking side roads avoiding congested traffic, drive late in the night

Family ask me for favours driving to the store and such and i just get things delivered‚Ä¶. 

Thoughts suggestions?

I always had anxiety, Idk if its just evolving as Im getting older. 

I have bought some aswagandha but haven‚Äôt taken it yet as Im trying to push back naturally from using it.

21914,"Tonight I met with a friend that I haven‚Äôt seen in a long time. We had a great time, had a few beers and chatted loads. 

We then decided to have a cigarette. Yes I know it‚Äôs bad but it‚Äôs been a while since we had one and we were having a good time so went ahead with it. I accidentally dropped mine on the street and proceeded to pick it up and smoked it anyway. It‚Äôs probably a few seconds after dropping and the pavement is on a relatively quiet area but still in a public areas. 

I didn‚Äôt think much of it but after a few hours I‚Äôm sitting here worried. I am afraid that I might‚Äôve caught something from smoking the cigarette dropped on the pavement. I‚Äôve always been a bit germaphobe so this is making my thoughts worse. I can‚Äôt sleep ‚Ä¶ 

Anyone here ever tried smoking a cigarette dropped on the floor? 

Sorry for the rant‚Ä¶. Just can‚Äôt stopped worrying.",anxiety
21728,"So before i start, let me make clear that i do have some health issue Well had, i was born with a unicuspid valve and had open heart surgery 2 years ago. Up to the surgery i was a mental wreck more than before. Now after the surgery ive been Well for the most part. I have had alot of fears after that actually got worse over the two years instead of better. Now to start This story up we gotta rewind a few months, its a few days after Christmas, im at granny inlaw having a good time, when My  girlfriend notice My right ankle is a little swollen above the achilles tendon, we call the emergency eoc and he wants ud to Come in, he frels it and want it scanned with ultrasound. It was fine. Now i didnt Think much of it then, but im sure My ankle above the achilles always was swollen but i havent ever really looked much at My ancles.
Now here is where it gets difficult two days later we Are home, i wake up and notice i have a coin sized point bit left from My sternum with minor pain,and I get spells of dizziness.
At night i get admitted to the ER and they do ultra sound, ekg, bloodwork work etc. And everythings fine, except from slightly elevated troponin which could be scar tissue, though they think i have a minor infection in my heart and release me sayinf i should be fine sfter some time but i dont feel fine. Onde home i get This feeling  of not being able to get enough air when I breath. A week later im back in the ER, they do the  usual checks plus a ct and guess what, im fine except for the same slightly elevated troponin and they release me Again sayings its just a minor infektion. 
3 weeks later i have an appointment with a specialised cardiologist that is educated for valve disease and has byen following me for over a decade. She checks me and im fine My heart is in a good condition. Now i didnt feel happy when told so, but extreme dissapointment, i started to get a feeling of fear of Them having made a mistake or missed something . The reason being is that before My surgery the hospital i was in the ER at, didnt see that My heart wasnt doing Well when I was in for chest pain(wasnt a heart attack, but My valve failing badly) the Same pain i have Now. 
Now i startede going to a psych every third week and its good. But at this point im uncertain of what is wrong, ive been checked at the hospital 3times and at a specialized cardiologist, and they havent found much that could explain the pain.
So im trying to accept the fact it could be anxiety driven, but the moment i started trying it, i got issues with breathing Again. Its like something in me wants to keeper me in pain and afraid. I Hope some Will read this and give some input.",anxiety

21683,"For a while I thought I was okay. For a while, I didn't feel socially anxious. 

I don't know what went wrong, but the thought of social interaction or going out into public spaces scares the hell out of me. For a while I never went grocery shopping because I just didn't want to deal with people. I don't want to talk to my classmates at all. I would feel more better about hiding and not having to deal with anyone. 

One of the most recent issues that's sending me into a spiral is that I need to do a task that involves leadership and giving directions. But it's difficult for me to communicate. It's as if the words are all sprawled out in my head and whenever I make an attempt at talking, it just comes across as disorganized and incoherent. I'm not a leader. I can't direct. I'd rather follow than lead. 

Today was especially horrible because I'm generally a well organized person who has it together, but my classmate ended up seeing how much of a mess I am. After something fell out of my plan, I got flustered, shut down entirely. It's so embarrassing, and now I want to hide from everyone.

21725,"tw: self-harm, bad thoughts? I'm not really sure what else, sorry

So uh, I've been feeling down and really anxious for thr past few weeks. It's probably silly, but I cut myself a while ago snd I hadn't done that for a while so I think it's really getting a low point. And it's probably just because of my poor emotional regulation stuff, but I kinda need to get this out because I don't have anyone else to talk to about this.

To start with, my academic workload's increased these past few weeks. I'm doing a research paper with a group, but it's just stressing me out. I'm um overthinking about how it would fail? Or if I'm not a good leader and I'm affecting my classmates' grades because of it. It's just, well, the thought of it is always there, and I can't really get rid of it because it's not yet done. 

Then there's this family tree project that we have, and I'm using my mom's family with it‚Äî I'm not really close with my dad's side of the family, so I can't exactly switch to his family. Uh the problem is, my mom has problems with her family, and I don't want to bring it up so I keep putting it off. I don't want to make her upset, and the thought of doing so is just making me anxious.

There's also the little things. Exams, quizzes, presentations, etc. I failed a quiz for the first time in a few years and my teacher got upset about it so I'm kinda panicking and trying to review more haha

Then well my birthday's coming up. We had this whole catering thing going on, but there's been problems with the payment and stuff. Mom made a mistake because she was outside when the manager asked for the payment, and she got really stressed because she couldn't get her money back. The manager hasn't exactly been cooperative, and they've been insistent on the payment, so yeah. Mom got angry and kinda blamed me cause I was the one who liked the idea of the catering thing. I promised her that I would take care of it since it was mostly my fault since she didn't like it but I pushed, so I've been in contact with the manager and everything but the situation's still messy. It's just more stress? More anxiety. Hooray, I guess.

We're still not done with the preparations and stuff and I really want to help but I've been busy with school, and when I get home there's no time to go outside and get what's needed. It's stressing Mom out, and I think that's part of the reason why she got angry, so I wanted to get this done. But I can't, and I have to wait for the weekends to actually be able to do stuff.

There's also the scholarship tests, although I've already taken them. It's just making me nervous, because if I didn't pass then it would be difficult to go to college becaude my family isn't really financially stable. It's just pressuring me? I think? I'm having trouble identifying how I feel without wanting to break down lol

It's also hard to fall asleep. I feel like the only rest I get is the minutes before I fall asleep, so I try to prolong it as long as possible. I think I'm afraid of waking up tomorrow because it just means that nothing's resolved yet and I just. Yeah.

Uh, that's it I guess. Sorry if this is all negative. If you have some advice (especially about the sleeping thing), it's all welcome! Thanks.",anxiety

21399,"I‚Äôve (24M) dealt with depression/anxiety for years now. I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. 

My depression eventually was ruled to be ‚Äútreatment resistant‚Äù after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I‚Äôd fall even further back from where I was. 

But now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I‚Äôve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I‚Äôve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don‚Äôt really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. 

I‚Äôm so scared as I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I‚Äôm going through stuff but my mom doesn‚Äôt even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn‚Äôt always around as he lives about 45 mins away.

I want to report how I feel during this project and I‚Äôll try to understand if my anxiety really goes away.

(thankuu for all the support it‚Äôs really cute)

Day 1/30 20.03 ‚úÖ

 ‚Ä¢ Overall, this day was easy for me, I didn‚Äôt experience any headaches from my new no-sugar-no-caffeine diet, my mind felt more a bit less stressed than yesterday though I slept 6 hours at night(I accidentally ate one sweet oopsies)But I had a public speech and my body responded with a fight or flight response‚ò†Ô∏è Public speaking is one of those things that I want to master by dealing with my anxiety issues‚Ä¶

Day 2/30 21.03 ‚úÖ

 ‚Ä¢ Lmaoo today I did feel those headaches after cutting caffeine. They were not so strong, though. I definitely feel less anxiety, but not so much. My legs almost died when I was running and my sneakers are dirty af(the weather conditions in my city are ‚ò†Ô∏è)Anyway, I did well.

 ‚Ä¢ I took a test so I can track my anxiety. I got 11/38 score, it was a social anxiety test because sometimes I start worrying when I talk with peopleü•≤The test results say that my anxiety level is considered as low, and that‚Äôs true, but I want to feel 100% confident around any person and in any situation. Public speaking still awakens in me fear of being judged, so it‚Äôs still a big way to go.

Day 3/30 22.03‚úÖ

 ‚Ä¢ It was really hard to get up from bed and I don‚Äôt know why, maybe because of cutting sugar. Meditated twice in the morning because yesterday I accidentally fell asleep while wanting to take a nap‚Ä¶ Omg my legs hurt so much when I runü§©Today I feel more stable than before this project and even yesterday as if my inner psychological core or something has grown stronger‚Ä¶ I stopped worrying about little things that always bothered me before this challenge. For example, I stopped hesitating to talk to handsome guysüòπ

Day 4/30 23.03‚úÖ

‚Ä¢ I probably won‚Äôt run today, my legs are sore. I stopped having mood swingsü´¢Feel much more relaxed than ever before. Things really bother me much less. I just stopped thinking random negative thoughts. My hands used to shake from stress sometimes, now it doesn‚Äôt happen.(upd no it still does)I had little eczema caused by my nervousness on the back of my hand, now it‚Äôs completely gone. Headaches don‚Äôt bother me, I don‚Äôt crave sweets, but I started to eat much more.

Day 5/30 24.03‚úÖ

‚Ä¢ I feel really goodü•∫I started to understand my anxious thoughts and emotions and realised how I used to repress them, their symptoms (rapid heartbeat, trembling hands). It‚Äôs funny how they‚Äôre going away now when I noticed my resistance towards them. Like, I used to get annoyed and try to control my body when my hands started shaking or tried to calm down my heart when I get worried, now I just‚Ä¶ let go of control. Today I also didn‚Äôt run, instead I walked 6kms on a high speed. I don‚Äôt mean to ruin the challenge, it just seems like I injured my legs.

I also happen to be in the refeeding process which makes me feel like crap when I eat, have been having menstrual GI symptoms, I have chronic constipation that I took Fybogel for (which always gives me a super loud tummy and gas) - so both of those things could be a contribution or cause of my stomach discomfort.

I am upping my lexapro dosage, so hopefully that helps. I know it takes a month or so for SSRIs to kick in, and I have only been on my new dosage for a week and a half, but I don't feel much better. I have a therapist too, and she hasn't been much help, even though she tries. 

I have just been struggling with this weird obsession for so long and I have been through so many cycles I just don't think I will ever break out of this mindset.",anxiety

21495,"My almost 10-year-old is six weeks into Prozac (started at 10 mg and went to 20 mg about 3 weeks ago). We're seeing violent outbursts almost nightly this week (the whole reason we started this was because of these, but they weren't nightly at the time). He'll be fine during the day and then everything goes south when bedtime hits. All the anxieties of the day start invading his thoughts and suddenly he's hitting, pulling hair, kicking, saying he wants to kill us, he wants to die. Full blown anger. I have to hide every single thing in the house that could be used as a weapon. Is this part of the process? My husband and I are trying to be calm and patient and use tools to help calm him down (using your senses, breathing with a stuffed animal on your belly, name it to tame it) but I just can't live like this. All day I dread bedtime and what it's going to bring. The thought of going through all this yet again tomorrow makes me sick. I need to know this will get better and we'll find the best way to help and get to the other side of this. It's so hard.",anxiety

21375,"**I've had an overwhelming fear of blindness and deafness for years.**

I developed **tinnitus** when I was in high school, due to exposure to loud music. My tinnitus isn't awful, I'm able to be productive around it. But ever since then, I've been fearful of one day losing all my hearing.

Also, I've been fearful about blindness, due to a family history of sight issues, **dry eye syndrome**, occasional **eye floaters**, and the fact I often work late nights on my laptop.

I saw a doctor about the eye floaters, but **was told that those are normal**, and most people get them.

I'm conflicted because I have a smartphone compulsion, which feeds my fear of visual impairment.

I just want to know how I can overcome **these fears because they often give me anxiety**, and I almost cried once out of fear my vision was getting cloudy.

I'm sure it's not the end all be all, but **I fear I won't be able to achieve my dreams (filmmaking) if my sight and hearing are affected.**

Awkward like: where do I look? Am I walking normal? Are people looking at me (not in a narcissistic way, but a low self confidence way)? 

I‚Äôve had this issue my entire life. This could be as simple as being at a somewhat crowded gym, completing a set in a designated area, and walking across the room to grab paper and sanitizer spray to wipe down my station. Or walking past a parked car with people in it.

22050,"ever since i was maybe 10-11, ive had an irrational fear of carbon monoxide poisoning. its gotten better now that im older, but it used to be so bad to the point where i would refuse to sleep some nights because i was convinced that i would die in my sleep from carbon monoxide poisoning, and that i wouldnt be able to hear the alarm going off if there ever was a leak.

i currently have one CO detector in my house (a battery operated one), and its in my living room. i recently read somewhere that CO detectors (at least the first alert ones, which is the kind i have) are only effective for about 5-7 years. i unplugged mine and checked the back and saw that the date of manufacture was march 2nd, 2016, which was almost exactly 7 years ago. although the alarm hasnt given the end of life warning yet. i even tested it to see if it was still working, and it was, although there was no green or red light. dont know if that means its not receiving power, or what, or if thats normal. 

its currently 11pm, so i cant really go out and buy another CO detector right now. im just scared that there will be a leak or something tonight, and that my detector wont go off and i'll die in my sleep, along with my pets. i know its extremely unlikely that there will be a CO leak tonight, but i cant help but think about it. i'll probably buy another detector tomorrow if im able to. im terrified right now. i feel like this is such a stupid thing to be afraid of, and im not really sure why ive been afraid of it for so long. any reassurance would be very much appreciated.

I've come to realize that I have a deep fear of hitting people. I don't believe this was induced by anything during my childhood - I led quite a happy, normal one. However, I've recently realized that I would never hit someone even if it came down to self-defense, and it's quite deterring. I simply can't bring myself to cause direct physical damage to someone - it feels like my muscles just disintegrate on me and my brain is doing everything possible to convince myself not to hit them.

21864,"From time to time when my anxiety is acting up, I start shivering almost violently. All of my muscles clench so hard that sometimes my abdomen begins to hurt.

I had to sit down and take a bunch of deep breaths before I could function.
I couldn‚Äôt even look at her or I‚Äôd just start shaking worse.

21988,"Hi everyone. I noticed my anxiety over the past couple months has gotten worse. I used to maintain decently w cbd here and there, but I find that I'm getting frustrated or my fight or flight is seriously kicking in






For context, just shopping in a store the other day. I'm reaching for a can of food and my bf is near me. Suddenly, a middle aged man w a cart barrels through towards me and an employee is inches from me, reaching for items directly below me. I suddenly moved so I wouldn't be touched or run over by this guy w the cart. No 'pardon me' 'excuse me', nothing.



This morning I come to do my laundry at my local laundromat. I usually chat w a little old lady here but she usually gets in my personal space to clean literally crumbs from the floor.



I am putting laundry in and I'm suddenly butt-to-butt with the laundry attendant, a woman comes in w a body bag sized laundry bag and almost hits me w it and I try to back up and the laundry woman is directly behind me, inches behind me




I finished loading the laundry and went to my car for a deep breath. I called my bf to vent and he understands mostly how I feel. I also am starting to feel like an emotional burden to him.



Idk how to cope anymore. I feel like I'm on edge all the time.
Any tips would be amazing. I don't have health insurance so I can't be seen by a doctor anytime soon

21608,"I‚Äôve had Crohns since I was 6 years old, currently 21, and it has affected me more than I realized. My mental health is very bad and has been since 2020. My mother passed away the moment I graduated high school in 2019 and I haven‚Äôt been the same since. I don‚Äôt have any other family near me to help me out, and I‚Äôm alone in my head all the time even though I have a girlfriend. She helps me as best as she can but it doesn‚Äôt change anything once nighttime comes around. Once she‚Äôs asleep I‚Äôm back to overthinking and start crying and want to just end it all. I miss my old life, I miss what I used to have, and I‚Äôll never be the same again. And just thinking about that kills me. I‚Äôve been told many of times to just think about the present instead of the future or past, or don‚Äôt think badly, try to think of all the good times and BS like that but it doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm mentally fucked up and physically with my stomach. I physically can‚Äôt work due to my Crohns, I‚Äôm on the toilet at least 5-6 times a day sometimes even up to 10 times. And it‚Äôs never pretty. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I‚Äôm on a small budget, and I‚Äôm just tired of feeling like this. I used to smoke weed but I‚Äôve stopped thinking it would help out in the long run but it hasn‚Äôt been any different since I‚Äôve quit. I will not take pills, I do not want to get addicted to anything or be stuck on psych meds. Please God can someone help me find a way to make it out. I‚Äôm so smart and I have such a good head on my shoulders but I just physically and mentally can‚Äôt work or do anything 70% of the day. Please, if anybody has any advice on what I can do to get the voices out of my head without admitting myself I would be forever grateful.",anxiety

21820,"Trigger warning: talk of cancer 

I‚Äôm 30f and I like to think I‚Äôve somewhat defeated my anxiety. I used to have awful panic attacks daily and I‚Äôve been panic attack free for months, I can‚Äôt remember my last one. 

But as my checkup approaches my anxiety is starting to return and im noticing my techniques are working less and less. 

My last check up in October seemed totally fine, then I got a call 2 weeks later saying something wasn‚Äôt right and it might be cancer. After 6 weeks of waiting and biopsies, it wasn‚Äôt cancer, but was the most advanced stage of precancer. I had surgery and got the ‚Äúall clear for now.‚Äù I will have to be checked every 6 months for 3 years. 

I got a call to remind me that I need to come in soon and I‚Äôm just sort of freaking out. Knowing I‚Äôll be waiting around for 2 weeks just expecting to see that number pop up and tell me it‚Äôs back or it‚Äôs cancer this time. 

Any advice for when your anxiety is around something very real, but also probably not likely (my doctor thinks it won‚Äôt come back and that I‚Äôll be ok).",anxiety

21223,"Lately I‚Äôve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won‚Äôt eat something that‚Äôs been already opened regardless of whether or not it‚Äôs mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can‚Äôt quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I‚Äôve only ever been technically ‚Äúdrugged‚Äù once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I‚Äôve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he‚Äôs unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I‚Äôm iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can‚Äôt afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.

21756,"Hi friends, new poster here. Turns out my entire family suffers from anxiety, and nobody shared this with me. My mom was medicated for it briefly, my dad is medicated for it and also has PTSD, and it runs in both sides of the family. I figured it out in my early 20's and I have been seeing all these  things about myself in a new light ever since. Currently suspicious that I might have ocd.

Something I am frustrated with is that I had a lot of signs and symptoms, but was quieter than my siblings so it got brushed off all the time. In highschool I had one friend, and she was always telling me I was a worrywart, and openly mocked me about things I did. (For example, I could never just cross a street. Had to be with the walk signal, and then I would RUN across it, and one day she made a big deal about it to my face)

Nobody ever asked WHY. Why I had almost no friends, why I didn't learn to drive until I was almost 30, why I am always going around giving people warnings about their safety. One time I had a complete breakdown after my parents got divorced, which was very rare for me. And my mom said ""she's just being dramatic and wants attention"" and that was the end of that. I was also ""the responsible one"". They just don't have time for my feelings.

I try to talk to my dad, who seems like the person who would understand the most, and I'll say ""I have been figuring out some stuff about driving and being anxious"" and he will go ""SPEAKING OF ANXIETY AND DRIVING, YOUR SISTER HAS COME ALONG SO FAR IN HER DRIVING!"" Or I will try to tell him I think I might have ocd and he will use this tone of disbelief and try to poke holes in what I'm saying to him.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just grateful that sometimes I can find places on the internet to talk about it. I don't have the worst anxiety in the world, but it's always there, all the time. I appreciate that you folks are able to take it seriously. Thank you for that.",anxiety

21701,"Some background- I‚Äôm currently 18 and I was the girl who had a big group of friends who genuinely didn‚Äôt hate each other and kept in touch, last semester of High school I lost touch and lost many friends even my two friends of 4+ years. 

I did get diagnosed with panic disorder but I also know panic attacks aren‚Äôt the only thing I get and I can develop anxiety over many things. 

I started dating a guy early in 2022 and towards the end I had started getting anxious over texts and even looking at iMessage itself sometimes then I developed some anxiety and shakiness when I wouldn‚Äôt hear back from him for a long time. It was a dark time for me, and I noticed I started getting anxious and was having bad thoughts about myself. 

Now I met this new guy probably a week after I broke it off with my ex and he‚Äôs great, we‚Äôre not dating but definitely exclusive, but from 5pm- 9pm he doesn‚Äôt message me for a long time and I understand he‚Äôs eating dinner, wants alone time for his own things but I hate having this shakiness in my hands and it feels like a rock weighing me down and I‚Äôm shaking everywhere all over my body like I can‚Äôt move. 

Sometimes I think the solution is to tell him ‚Äúhey can you text me back in x amount of time‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like how you don‚Äôt message me for awhile‚Äù sure, short term solution but I know things will come up and he‚Äôll eventually resent me for making him do that, and this goes way beyond him as well. 

Even if we break things off in the future I don‚Äôt want to have major anxiety over the next guy and go through these feelings again and again and I want a permanent solution. Help?",anxiety

21252,"At the time I was sober going on 18, 19 years. I was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. 

For the longest time, especially since sobriety, I've been overwhelmed with thinking. Space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. 

But, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck I had no confidence in myself as having any quality. It seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life.   


My last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. I couldnt handle the pressure. I was so dependant on others for everything I was asking if I was sweeping properly. Very bad mindset. A lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. I didnt understand how that could be. It seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. That was my last day at my last job. It was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! 

I've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago I got into therapy from a mental health episode. During that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in Virginia (Fredricksburg) I met a man that changed my life. He went by the name Bose Uncle. He taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. You breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. Also roughly. Dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. 

On down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. Overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety I'd never expierenced before I saw a vision. It seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to Bill Wilson from AA. A wind blew through me. His words. My words on it are, I was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. I was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. I let it go. The moment. I stopped holding and figuring. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like my being afraid got wore out. I remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" I calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. That old fire and brimstone god. Intstead I chose ""my concept"" of life as my God. My ideas are good to. Changed life.   


About six months later I nearly died from pancreatitis. When I got home from 6 days in the hospital I shared it on facebook. I received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. I did not get what I thought I would. People coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. I nearly fucking died. I know hundreds of people. What does that mean? My perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, I need to change.   


I did not think that way at first. At first I thought, ""I fucking hate everyone."" For a while. 

Then 6 months later, I got diagnosed with autism. April 24th 2021.   


6 months later after learning to relax, I rested on my heels for the first time in my life. This began the second chapter of my life. The taking my time portion. The I am the most impotant person in my life to me. You all come second. For ever. I no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. I have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement.   


Did you know that your body can control your mind. If you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind.   


You receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. This moves you. If you are not aware of it. Make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move (behavior speed) amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. I havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. Now I dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but I do stay aware I think from a bit of fear.   


You can control your thinking!   


You can control your thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. Moving the body oddly slow is not odd. Not speaking is an answer. And, you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out.

I not a great driver either, I get too close to the pavement and don‚Äôt like going fast. When its focusing on parking I‚Äôm less stressed out, as it‚Äôs an empty car park. 

I guess I don‚Äôt like having to concentrate and although there is less to concentrate on with an automatic I still don‚Äôt like it. When I‚Äôm a passenger unless it‚Äôs like a short trip I‚Äôm asleep or if it‚Äôs short I am looking around or checking my phone.

Went on much faster roads and lots of roundabouts, accidental knocked a curb and someone on a roundabout in the left lane decided to give way to a truck waiting on the left while I was also on the roundabout in the right lane.

Been having like 1.5 hour lessons and although I make sure that I don‚Äôt have much to drink before hand and go to the bathroom twice before my lesson. There is always anxiety and I‚Äôm either running from the car or very unfortunately last week was at the lights and far from being able to leave the car and I‚Äôm still mortified.

21276,"A bit of background: I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. 

I‚Äôm 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. I‚Äôve dated a lot over the past few years, but this is the first time in ages where I‚Äôve REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them, and anxiety doesn‚Äôt play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed, and I‚Äôm getting crushed. 

Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me, obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning, freaking out if she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt respond to my messages within a couple hours. It‚Äôs taking over my life. My work is slipping, I can‚Äôt sleep well, a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that she‚Äôs very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I don‚Äôt want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface I‚Äôve been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on, because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.",anxiety

22009,"I know this feeling is unjust, but I can't help but feeling dreadfully anxious and sad that my best friend didn't want me at a night on the Weekend. 

I'd been excluded before in this group of friends when they went on holiday last year together. I was really upset then and just so happened to be very down at that time anyway so I ended up bringing it up and we got into a huge fight where he said he hadn't meant to and these things just happened, but also, I needed to back off.

So this weekend, he said he'd got a ticket for this night but downplayed it like it was only him and another guy and not the whole group going. But everyone from that group went. He said he hadn't known they were but I'm sure that's not true and now on reflection, they had probably planned it for months. 

I know I have no right feeling this way, people can do what they want but I can't help but feeling really sad about it, like he didn't want me there for a reason and after last time, I don't want to mention anything because I don't think he'd take it well. I know we should be able to do different things, and I'm not saying otherwise but I know everyone in this group and wonder why he didn't want me there. It's making me feel pretty low. We live together but I'm moving out next week, and a part of me is worried he'll slowly cut me out of his life.

21672,"I hate driving to new places, and this has helped me tons:

1. Pre-research the address: if the time is flexible, what times are the least busy (google maps is a good one to check). Is the destination open (check the website ahead of time).
2. Use Street View to check out the entire route.
3. Get your nav app all ready. I‚Äôve found that Apple Maps (if you have this) is amazing because it will say things like don‚Äôt make right after this stoplight. Make a right at the next one. The destination is in the right, pull into the next driveway on your left, etc.
4. Leave with plenty of time to spare. Assume you will make a few wrong turns. Give yourself extra time to lose your way.
5. Research parking ahead of time. Use apps like Parking Hero. Use the city‚Äôs websites to find out the capacity of municipal parking ramps, if available. Scope out street parking with Google Street View, too.
6. Find alternatives to parallel parking. You can also park near driveways, so you can‚Äôt get parked in (easy pull in/out).
7. Dress comfortably so that if you get stressed, you won‚Äôt get super sweaty.
8. Make sure you have enough gas
9. Adjust your mirrors, clean windows, headlights for visibility, ahead of time
10. Listen to calming music/driving playlist 
11. Get toll money/EZ pass ready ahead of time",anxiety

21418,While back ago I started experiencing severe panic attacks. So severe my heart rate would be 160-180. I completely stopped sleeping. Even when I tried to focus on sleep I‚Äôd only nap for 20-30 mins a day. I stopped eating and drinking water to the point where my kidneys and liver were severely dry. I lost 25 pounds in just the span of 2 weeks. I started therapy a month ago. Everything has been going well. My only problem is that I‚Äôm on lorazepam as needed and sertraline daily. And I‚Äôve let my therapist know that I truly do not want to be on medications. And she‚Äôs advised spiritually healing. I‚Äôve been practicing reiki. And just curious if anyone else has resorted to spiritual healing?,anxiety
21351,"24M, 6‚Äô , 215 pounds 
I have what I believe to be anxiety disorder. I almost always have some sort of anxiety. Sometimes I feel a little cloudy and maybe even a bit u stable on my feet. The worst is when I‚Äôll be working; doing something minimally exhausting but my heart rate will raise to over 120 and then the panic ensues. The rapid rate can last hours. Maybe I am a hypochondriac and the more I think and check my pulse the worse it gets. Does anyone else have this happen? I have asked my doctor for a referral to a cardiologist just to be sure. I‚Äôm currently on no medication.",anxiety

I'm about to get the opportunity to go on an all-expenses paid (totally free) one week trip to the Netherlands with colleagues. But I'm afraid to go in case anxiety takes over me being away from home.

Almost two years ago I had my first bout of anxiety for no apparent reason. One day it came and took hold of me and I spent more than a month in a daze without being able to leave the house or walk down the street...

Hopefully I managed to ""get over it"", but I feel that this period/stage marked my life as always. Now I live in fear and things that I liked to do before I have stopped doing or I don't do them for fear that it will make me anxious.

Among them, I always planned to travel as much as possible with family and friends the day I had a stable job and recurring income. Well, now I am in that situation but I do it for fear of getting anxiety outside the house, not being able to control it and the situation exploding.

I still remember the panic attacks I used to get for no reason (I had no reason to) and I shudder.... It was the worst situation and time of my life. I feel that it has marked me forever.

My life is highly limited and I'm quite young...",anxiety

Now I've tried everything with these meds be it smoking or alcohol I stopped all of it because it caused very nasty problems with me when I stopped I finally felt myself even through I've read on Wikipedia that coffee can also cause problems when you take these meds it's says even small amounts can cause side effects that's called caffeine induced anxiety.

I'm not really sure how am I supposed to be awake I mean I'm unemployed still in hands of my parents and other family members who take care of me and understand my problems but how did you manage to stay awake without coffee or did coffee really help you without feeling weird all time while on meds?

21211,"I think ever since I was bullied in school I always was afraid of people. I missed so many opportunities in my life because no matter how many self help books I was reading, I was just not able to overcome my anxiety. And even if I managed to be ""normal"" around people I still felt lonely. Because I felt like an alien, like I was different to everyone else.

‚ùå A normal relationship with a woman who accepts me for who I am? --&gt; **Not available since I finished school!**

‚ùå Friends with whom I can share my hopes and dreams and who I feel deeply connected with? --&gt; **Not for me!**

‚ùå Just interact with people without feeling completely nervous and socially awkward? --&gt; **Impossible!**

With 22 I knew that either I have to change something or it will stay like this forever!

It was a wild journey ever since and despite a lot of set backs, rejections, insecurities and the feeling that I am too unlovable for anyone I can say that **I** **overcame my social anxiety.**

I don't want to brag with this post, the only thing I want is to give you hope in times where you maybe feel no hope.

Maybe this here is the motivation for YOU to take the first step today. To look out of the comfort zone a tiny little bit. To get help when you need help, as it is a sign of strength to ask for help not of weakness. **If this here reaches one person who is struggling today I've done my job.**

Because no matter how tall the wall seem that you are looking at right now, it is possible to overcome it.

**If you need help or advice, I'll be there for you in the comments! ‚¨áÔ∏è**",anxiety

21662,"Hi everyone, I was posting to see if anyone else suffered from anxiety and has heart issues going on as well. I have severe anxiety and I‚Äôm definitely a hypochondriac so I started taking Zoloft 3 months ago to help. However, for 2 years I have dealt with heart problems. My heart rate gets super high to the 170s at rest, I get dizzy, chest pain, and I have a low-ish blood pressure on top of that. I also noticed a couple months ago this feeling I get where I feel like my heart skips a beat and my breath gets taken away which I discovered was me having PVCs. I have done numerous EKGs which have been abnormal but my one cardiologist told me I‚Äôm a 26 year old otherwise healthy person so it‚Äôs fine. I did an echo and stress test 2 days ago so I‚Äôm awaiting those results. One of my previous cardiologists told me he believes this all stems from stress and anxiety and once I manage that it will go away, which I agree with to an extent. I had another cardiologist tell me that even if I‚Äôm stressed out having a heart rate sustain in the 170s is abnormal. I am also a nurse so I can‚Äôt tell if me having an understanding of medical stuff makes it more difficult for me to handle because I‚Äôm constantly thinking worst case scenario. I have this overwhelming fear that I‚Äôm going to be one of those people in their 20s that has a heart attack or other complication. I‚Äôve seen people post on here previously saying their heart rate goes super high when they‚Äôre anxious but I wasn‚Äôt sure if anyone had similar experiences as me or knows anything about this. I‚Äôm sure I am overthinking this but I also don‚Äôt like the fact that I constantly have chest pain and a high heart rate.",anxiety

21310,"6 to 7 years ago I was diagnosed with GAD/PTSD. 2 years ago I was diagnosed with adhd. I have managed it all this time with no medicine, and I have been fine with for the most part. The only time my anxiety would rise a little bit is when it was triggered by stress. Which then I knew I just had to balance it out again.

Well, this month ended up with heighten anxiety due to an allergic reaction being around seafood, one week later got a tooth pulled, 2 days later I was fussed at by an ER doctor, and then one week later after that I had anxiety reflux kick back so hard that it cause two days of back to back panic attacks. My anxiety was so bad that I couldn‚Äôt eat anything but rice and chicken, no meds, and being around doctors frighten me. I couldn‚Äôt manage to get myself out of that anxiety loop. 

Well I was finally about to get some hydroxyzine  for ‚Äúas needed dosage‚Äù 3 weeks later. My anxiety was down back to a manageable level but my fears were still there. I took one 25 mg pill in the evening. I got an euphoria feeling and drowsiness the whole next day along with diarrhea. Then all my anxiety was gone. I can eat food again without fear. I‚Äôm not scared to take meds again. 

This is the weirdest Anxiety is the moment I have ever dealt with. However, I‚Äôm now pondering if with my anxiety reflux being kicked up it had my stomach and brain a relay lap so when I took the hydroxyzine it suppressed that nerve in my stomach and it help my stomach feel better and then which stop the relay cycle. I guess that is something I will have to remember to ask my doctor.",anxiety

22162,"So first off, I apologize for the millionth post about ‚Äúhas anyone felt like this‚Äù. Been struggling to post anything for that reason. I‚Äôve been having really bad anxiety these past 2-3 months. My dad passed away in December and I had to put my dog down a week ago so I definitely think this has affected my greatly. I‚Äôve never felt this ‚Äúbad‚Äù for this long. Been waking up most days shakey and nervous. Most days I‚Äôm worrying about my health and can‚Äôt seem to shake off intrusive thoughts. I went to the Doctor on Thursday and was told my blood pressure was high, which made me more anxious. Was precribed some for blood pressure and sertraline for the anxiety. Today I‚Äôve been feeling dizzy, it comes and goes and just loosing interest in normal things. Just a general feeling of feeling off or not all here. Also can‚Äôt seem to swallow very well. 

I‚Äôm starting to exercise more and eating healthier. I‚Äôm hoping to see if anyone has any words of encouragement or has had a similar experience as mine. Also, anyone taking sertraline has any side effects? Anything would help rn. Thank you!

Edit: Side note last night I took a chocolate piece which had cbd and a strand of THC to help me sleep. It made me feel slow and like I wasn‚Äôt fully there and gave me really bad dry mouth feeling. Idk if maybe I‚Äôm still feeling those symptoms, because still feel out of it and my throat feels like I have something stuck there.",anxiety

21288,"
Hey r/anxiety, 

I am in a very tough spot rn, i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years, started my teaching certification programme (in my country you need to do this), but after 3 weeks I was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain, diarrhea, insomnia. So after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job (like a 10 h job) in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services (the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me).
I still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies (tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them, if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them, my divorced father had to pay me 112 ‚Ç¨ a month for instance) and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. However they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out ASAP in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my CV.
Because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library (smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly) as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying, shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. She says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. 

As a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days, i have lost 3 kg of weight, lack any appetite, have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. Yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. In her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. So in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. Today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. Yday I talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country (we are in EU so travelling is no problem). I have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it (i was paying my fam 250 ‚Ç¨ a month from the teacher pay), so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. 
I have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for a few weeks now but have had very little success. I have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. I think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. After explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic.

Some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? Am i doing the right thing? Am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now?

What do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? What should i have done in your opinion? Kind of asking as a reality check",anxiety

21804,"I got my discharge letter from child mental health services and it had the usual things in. But it then had a paragraph saying ""it's important to note the patients diagnosis of ... And anxiety"" a different psych told me the anxiety is from a different disorder I disagree but still it seems weird I wasn't told or discussed with about it. 

And only ""anxiety"" a close family member has GAD and another has social anxiety but never heard of it like how they wrote it. I don't really care what label is put on me for myself but my new mental health team is going to get this letter and prescribe medication/therapy accordingly. As I do really struggle with anxiety I'd like to get help for it but this seems like it's not a legitimate things and just a passing comment.

If it helps they removed eupd from the original psychiatrist and added ""anxiety"" is it just people don't like diagnosing bpd so used this as a substitute? I live in care so although I don't like having the label bpd it does give my support workers different expectations (emotional disregulatuion, abandonment issues, destructive behaviour). 

I've emailed both psychiatrist but it seems as I'm not their patient amymore they won't respond lol",anxiety

21624,"So I‚Äôm not too sure if this is the correct place to post this or get advice, but I‚Äôd just like to hear what people have to say about it. 

I‚Äôve been working at my engineering job for 4 years now. It‚Äôs a decent job with VERY good pay and decent hours that work for me. But for the same amount of time it has been the main source of my anxiety. It‚Äôs quite a tricky job with a lot of learning involved, and it‚Äôs taken me a long time to get to grips with. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes in the process and with some parts of the job I still feel anxious about what I‚Äôll have to do or about making mistakes while doing those things. 

The main thing however is the environment, and one particular person in it. We‚Äôll call him Bob (say hello Bob). He used to be my team leader, but stepped back from that role to become team engineer (still a somewhat ranked role in itself but more technical) and is one of the most experienced and gifted guys at the place, having been there for decades at this point. Let me preface by saying a good chunk of the time this guy is ok. 

However, Bob is VERY hotheaded and temperamental, and can be passive aggressive, will openly berate people for innocent mistakes and will make ‚Äújokes‚Äù about co-workers and their abilities/performance that often seem to have a hint too much opinion behind them (often to the point where you‚Äôre not sure when he‚Äôs joking and when he isn‚Äôt). He takes his job very very seriously, often to the point of some sort of corporate Stockholm syndrome devotion (that may be an exaggeration but you get what I mean). As an example, he‚Äôs gone off on one at me before for not working much overtime and he has commitment and that‚Äôs why he does loads (implying I don‚Äôt pull my weight by not working weekends etc).

His whole demeanour makes me extremely uncomfortable and feel intimidated, because I don‚Äôt know when he‚Äôs gonna be in one of his bad moods or take issue with something. It‚Äôs been joked about before whether we‚Äôre gonna get Jekyll or Hyde today. 

About 2 months ago he openly berated (near shouting) in front of the whole team and my manager for misplacing a tool during an audit (which I understand is a bit negligent, but I did find it quickly afterwards), it was embarrassing and made me feel small, especially since that could‚Äôve been handled in a far more professional manner. The other day, he made a comment about my rate of work, rhetorically asking ‚Äújokingly‚Äù why I can only do 1 of something while he can do a lot more in the same amount of time. Funnily enough he‚Äôs done that multiple times in the past and it never fails to make me feel heightened and worthless. I get that I‚Äôm a slow worker and not the most skilled, but he makes it out as if I‚Äôm lazy and not bothered about my job‚Ä¶ I am very much the opposite. I just have less experience and work at a slower pace than most because I worry so much about getting things wrong.

I just don‚Äôt find Bob very approachable and that makes it even more difficult because he‚Äôs our team engineer, which means sometimes I have to ask him questions. But it‚Äôs been very often that he‚Äôs responded to questions as if they‚Äôre stupid or something I should‚Äôve known already.

What doesn‚Äôt help is that for the longest time the team has enabled his behaviour, saying to me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take it personally, it‚Äôs just the way he is‚Äù. Even recently when another team member was talking to me like crap and I spoke to my manager about it after finally having enough, I mentioned Bob and while he spoke to the other person and she hasn‚Äôt bothered me since, he said he wasn‚Äôt gonna talk to Bob at this time because it ‚Äúrequires a far more delicate approach‚Äù. From what I understand Bob has his own issues, one of them being bad anxiety but it seems like he‚Äôs dealing with it in very unhealthy ways.

At this point, I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I don‚Äôt feel like I can ask my manager to do something about it because of his Bob might react or what he might do. It‚Äôs not like the company would do anything anyway because he‚Äôs so good at his job and does a hell of a lot. I could move teams, where the work would be more challenging so I could be Maliki life harder for myself. But if I stay I have to stay in an environment that makes me constantly anxious and seriously affects my mental health, to the point where just leaving my job has crossed my mind in moments of madness.

Any advice or ways to maybe cope with this would be really welcomed. 

TL;DR my job and a person there make me incredibly anxious, and I don‚Äôt know what to anymore.",anxiety

22036,"Hello everyone I hope you‚Äôre okay!

So from January 24th up to know I have fallen back into my anxious state. 

It all started when I went to the big city in January I hadn‚Äôt felt anxious in months and I love the city so didn‚Äôt expect it. When I was walking off my train all the way down to the shopping centre I felt my legs and they didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô not weak but not strong and I was really aware of them and felt like my legs would just fail to walk and I‚Äôd fall over. The more I walked the more I started to stress out it got to the point where I felt dizzy and a bit lightheaded cause I was panicking and BOOM it hit I‚Äôm think OMG am I going to pass out ! I started to panic and think maybe it was diabetes but I‚Äôm a slim 22 year old male with no health conditions but in the moment I was panicking it was horrible so derealised and the fear of impending doom ! And then 3 days later I imagine because my nervous system was stimulated I was at my grans putting her bins out and for no apparent reason 0-100mph panic attack my legs instantly out of nowhere felt weak ish and shaky and so didn‚Äôt my arms and I let out this big exhale and I felt off balance and kind of dizzy in my head I rushed out the house into the car and sat there for a minute and I was okay but walking from my car to the house again made it happen mildly. Fast forward to today 20th of June i am still struggling with anxiety. Not the instant panic attack weak legs. This is like a head pressure feeling kinda like I‚Äôm tilting my head. Anyway I get this when I go on walk and panic and think I‚Äôm gonna pass out or fall over and then I think it‚Äôs something serious. I am also getting. It in shops. Although I have been in 4 shops the past few days just to ivercome this feeling. The past two times I had it very mild but made it without a panic attack and rushing out. B  it because of this and headaches ( I want to say all my symptoms don‚Äôt hurt and they aren‚Äôt terrible they are 3/10  maybe 4.5/10 when panicking in terms of intensity but i still panic thinking I‚Äôm gonna fall to the ground or pass out. HOW DO I GET OVER THIS because I‚Äôm currently thinking I have a brain tumour. Basically all I want is reassurance that it‚Äôs anxiety and it‚Äôs not high blood pressure (had blood pressure check at doctors this year after walking there and it was fine) diabetes( I had general blood tests before and I didn‚Äôt have diabetes I am also a slim male 22) brain tumour ( head pressure and headaches making me think. Fairly certain I had similar dizziness years back when my anxiety was at my peak and my doctor kept telling me no brain tumour about 3 years ago. Also I‚Äôm scared of having low iron but I guess I just eat more iron and I‚Äôll be okay ? Please let me know what you think. I have had 6 heart tests from three years ago up until now and it‚Äôs fine!

Thank you in advance

I am also starting to feel my heart rate again to check it and it‚Äôs stressing me out and making me more aware of it!

Also need to mention I play computer games for like 4 hours a day and not that far from my monitor lol. Could be this ? I am also on my phone a lot",anxiety

21323,"So it was my biology class and it was one of those classes where I had none of freinds in and was extremely uncomfortable every lesson because alot of the time we were made to answer questions infront of the class or have to find partners and obviously me being awkward and with social anxiety I never j never had a partner.

And because of this I always would get a red face from embarrasment and I guess she took notice because the time we we learning about why the face goes red she decided to ask me a question about it knowing my face would go red and once it did she said ""oh look it's happening now"" which obviously made it 10x worse and she littarly made me stand up and face the class it was one of the worst days of my school life.

Ok so kinda a weird post, and I‚Äôm not sure if it belongs here, but I figured this sub was probably the best one for it. I also tried the social anxiety sub, but my post was instantly removed. So basically I have this huge fear of asking my mom for things because I think she will judge me for them. I don‚Äôt have this fear around anyone else (I couldn‚Äôt care less what anyone else thinks of me) but for some reason I have it with her. I‚Äôm not talking about little things like asking for something at the store or asking for basically any necessity. I‚Äôm talking about bigger things like hair dye, piercings, or really anything to do with clothing. For example, recently I worked up the confident to ask her over text if I could dye my hair, which she is fine with, however later that day when she asked me to show her pictures of what I want, I chickened out and got to scared to show her.  It‚Äôs like I knew she would say yes, but I was still to scared to show her because I was afraid she‚Äôd say something judgmental to me. She has always been sorta judgmental towards me but  I really want to get over this fear because it prevents me from getting a lot of the things I really want. Is there anything I can do?",anxiety

Unfortunately, my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a (relatively) nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex.... I REALIZE THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.... as most of my anxiety is.

So this became a trigger for a multi-week bout of extremely high anxiety and this person definitely realized that they were the trigger for it one way or another......... and now it seems like they are at the point that they are starting to get a little freaked out and I'm afraid of losing one of my closest friends.

I have identified and hypothesized that this is really a form or manifestation of narcissism, and possibly a coping mechanism. 

Throughout my journey of anxiety, my brain has tried to deal with the helplessness of anxiety by trying to twist my crippling anxiety into a form of grandiosity (delusional), which I am hypothesizing is the narcissism aspect.",anxiety

Hello, I'm new to this community and I need your support. I am diagnosed with obsessive ocd disorder (rocd) severe depression and emotional addiction and a few hours ago i was in the middle of an ocd crisis and i came across something that triggered me as I was in full compulsion. It was about attachment styles can someone please tell me if i am a good person to love my partner and that an emotionally dependent person has the right to love someone and date them . I'm in such a healthy relationship and I'm proud of it because my previous relationship was very chaotic and so toxic and I'm afraid to be with him that because of my emotional dependency I want to be with him because i love it with all my heart but my thoughts are killing me (i think it's the ocd side pressing where it hurts) Thank you all. Be kind please my ocd makes me believe so many things through messages and it's horrible.",anxiety
21626,"Hi everyone, I wanted to just put a note here to see if this is a common symptom people experience (even with medication).

Ever since 2020, I developed severe anxiety that seemed to arise behind the wheel. It started with little things; I would hit a bump and would spend a little longer looking in the rear view mirror than I ordinarily would. 

Eventually, it escalated to the point where I would compulsively circle blocks or pull over just to make sure that these bumps and potholes were not pedestrians. And if I did circle a block, usually there would be OTHER potholes or bumps, which would lead to a mental downward spiral that drove me, quite literally, to insanity. It was one of these spirals that led to my first trip for psychiatric evaluation.

After beginning medication, this generally subsided to a manageable level, and with CBT I was doing pretty good. Then, in December of 2022, my wife and I were stopped at a red light when us and two other vehicles were completely totalled by an F350 who rear ended us, travelling at roughly 80 KMh. He ran from the incident. Everyone was miraculously not seriously injured, but I‚Äôve been set back to pre medication levels of anxiety while driving. 

This hyper-vigilance (I drive quite a bit) has now lead to significant physical illness for me. From stress, I‚Äôve ground my molars to completely flat, and the tension within my body from being so, braced? I guess? And overly vigilant while driving, is really locking me up. I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight, too. It‚Äôs lead to serious depression as I‚Äôve built a life that requires me to have a limber body.

Does anyone have any similar stories to share? Or even just some relevant encouragement‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really getting to the end of my rope lately because of this.

Thank you beautiful humans, please drive safe and treat yourself gently.",anxiety

21789,"Hi All,

I never had an issue with needles, no fear whatsoever. I got bloodtests regulary. I had a bloodtest last year, and I'm very pale and the nurse had issues finding a vein. Anyway, she just stuck it in and said "" oops "" I felt a sharp pain up my left arm, she must have pierced a nerve. I felt light headed and sick and next thing I woke up a few minutes later lay down on the bed, I passed out  


It was the weirdest experience as it's never happened before. I need to have another blood test soon and I keep putting it off out of fear of this happening again. Are there any meds that can help?

22179,"I'm almost 40 so my life is nearly half over and I feel like I've done nothing with it. Especially because for some stupid reason I've placed all my eggs in one basket and insisted on becoming a successful author no matter how stupid or hard or impossible it is to do that these days. I haven't even tried to date anyone in over 10 years so though I'd like a relationship, I'm socially inept and awkward. I also have a lot of baggage not just from an abusive father but from two abusive relationships I was stupid enough to get into. At my age with my history, no one wants to even attempt to deal with that nonsense and as I said I'm inept at socializing because of my own problems. I don't have a ""career"" like my siblings. I don't have a family. I don't even have a job because of a permanent disability making it almost impossible for me to work. Though I have written several novels, they more than likely will never see anything resembling profit or commercial success. Most of my days are spent playing video games, hating my life, and writing because I'm too stubborn to give up on that dream despite every single sign telling me that I'm old, it's over, and there's no way I'm talented enough to make it work. 

I know that people will say that I shouldn't measure my success by other people or people around me but let me tell you. It's exceedingly hard to show up to family functions when all your siblings are married professionals with their own houses and you are the loser who has been single for 15 years because she can't manage to get into a relationship that's not abusive and would prefer to stay at home, alone with her cat who's gonna die soon anyway because he's old. If you want to suggest therapy or medication...I've done both. Medication isn't a fix for me and I've tried it on and off for years. Therapy has been a constant in my life since I was 18 so if you can possibly imagine it I was far worse than \*this\* before now. If anything I could \*possibly\* say it's a miracle that I've come as far as I have with recovering from abuse, dealing with addiction, an eating disorder, and my anxiety issues. Yet, at the same time, I desire things that I'm 99% sure I can never have and I know I'm running out of time. Is there any way to cope with the fact that my life just isn't going to get fixed and I'm pretty much doomed to waiting the clock out for the next 30-40 years if I'm somehow lucky enough not to get cancer or some other terrible disease?",anxiety

21354,"(26 year old female) sorry for the long post‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft &amp; then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often &amp; have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that‚Äôs when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I‚Äôve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn‚Äôt have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a medication issue or lack of something. I‚Äôm mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since I‚Äôm not doing well lol.

Long story short, I came prepared and specifically asked for one of two meds (wellbutrin and buspar). The dr + supervising physician refused to prescribe either. One bc im at a high risk of seizures bc family history + alcoholism + other meds... that was the one I wanted most bc it does depression, anxiety, adhd, and helps w nicotine / alcohol cessation. The other one was the only other anxiety med I was willing to try and they said no bc it doesn't treat depression, only anxiety. The hypothesis is that my severe anxiety is the only reason I am able to function with slightly-less-severe depression, so they don't want to prescibe it bc the fear is if they treat the anxiety but not the depression I will quickly spiral into a deep depression.

I haven't felt this depressed in quite a while. I don't want to take an SSRI, and it feels like my only option is that or panic attacks wherein I get so stressed out my blood pressure rises high enough to give me nosebleeds like an anime character.",anxiety

I‚Äôve been following this community for a while, and I just wanted to share my story and maybe meet some people going through or who have been through a similar situation. I've never felt more alone in my life and I feel like I'll be heard here. 

I‚Äôm 21, and growing up wasn‚Äôt easy. I carry a lot of trauma and guilt from seeing my mom sick pretty much my whole life and growing up in a toxic environment. I always took care of my mom from a young age which made me very attached to her, and honestly, even though she was sick, she was really the best mother I could‚Äôve ever asked for. fast forward, after a lot of treatment and a lot of struggle, my mom recovered :) and 2022 was one of her best years. she was very healthy and started doing very well. It was the best year for my family and me as a whole. unfortunately, that came to an end, and she suddenly passed in November 2022. That came as a big shock to everyone because she was so healthy. no health problems, regular tests, she was perfectly fine. Everything for me came crashing down. I've always had anxiety, and due to that anxiety, I was vaping heavily for so many years (6 to be exact) until February 6th, 2023, came around. I had one of the worst panic attacks ever, and now I'm dealing with so many symptoms. Got so many tests done because I was having so many stroke-like and heart attack-like symptoms. Tests came back pretty much all normal, and I got diagnosed with a panic disorder and health anxiety. My psychiatrist thinks due to my mom passing away so suddenly, and I also have an underlying fear for myself.

I'm writing this because I've never felt so alone. I feel like people close to me don't understand what I'm going through physically and mentally, and I just want to be my old self again. All these symptoms started so suddenly, and I'm scared almost every day, not knowing if I will wake up the next day or what might happen to me. I'm scared my own body will fail me.  I'm tired, and I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone. I'm trying my best to correlate everything with anxiety, but it's so hard. 

Thank you so much for reading if you did read all of this. I will be okay, and I will get better. I'm slowly starting to see progress. 
Cheers to a lovely life ahead :)",anxiety

21710,"Hello first time posting here but I feel like I'm going to explode.
So a few weeks ago I got the ""amazing"" idea to get blonde highlights, like a balayage. I don't know if it's because how the hairstylist did them, because my hair is wavy or I'm just this insecure. But now every time that I see myself on the Kinrara I hate my hair so much, like what the he'll I did to my precious color.
I'm thinking to get dyed at home because I can't deal anymore with hairstylists and giving explanations, but it makes me SO ANXIOUS to not get a color that matches my hair. I just want my highlights to dissappear.
I'm feeling like a mess and I don't know how to proceed and I don't want to hear the others saying how I'm wasting my money after getting the highlights . I just want to feel peace at something.",anxiety

21879,"So basically I‚Äôve suffered anxiety for a few years now but more recently in the past couple months I feel it‚Äôs taken over my life with intense physical symptoms and constant brain fog as well, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it‚Äôs hard to live.

My only issue is Ik how addictive Benzos are so I don‚Äôt wanna take it everyday but on days I don‚Äôt take it I feel the usual physical symptoms panic attacks and feeling like shit all day. I want to possibly meet with a psychiatrist to find a more long term and safer solution but it‚Äôs hard because my doctors booked out for weeks. Does anyone know a way to speed up this process and also recommendations for what I should being in my current situation? I rlly don‚Äôt wanna get addicted to Benzos and idk how long that takes but I don‚Äôt wanna risk it (I‚Äôm on a small dosage of 0.5 mg a day)",anxiety

21363,"I'm not talking about mania or hypomania here. But in the past I increased my escitalopram dose a few times. I was really ""climbing the ladder"" dose-wise (I think that I had to increase the dose over and over in order to keep the ""happy"" effect going) so I had to quit and come back down to the proper dose. I felt unbelievably great as I increased the dose. I took notes on my experience and I was just saying how great I felt and how I had nice memories of my family and my past...my mood was just great.

Antidepressants have been in use for a while now so I'm sure there's some wisdom about (1) whether being happy like that is sustainable, (2) whether it's healthy or not, and (3) whether I could've actually ended that phenomenon of chasing the effect up the ""dose ladder"" and gotten the effect to ""stick"".

Most importantly, when the ""happy"" effect was in place all my ADHD medications were working. This was absolutely life-changing. I can read in my notes that it says over and over ""if I could only maintain this level of healthy brain-functioning and ADHD-medication effectiveness then I would have a great life"". I wonder if there's anything to be learned from this whole experience that I had with the escitalopram and the ADHD medications; maybe the experience can provide a clue as to what to try in order to have a sustainable foundation for my ADHD medications.

I do have some anxiety/depression/OCD; I don't think that it's at the clinical level. I mean, I looked up the criteria for OCD and one of them said something about the issues taking up an hour of your time each day, so I'm far from that. And when it comes to depression and anxiety, it's a situation where I have mild issues where you could probably say that it's unhealthy for me to have the negative tilt to my emotions that I have...again it's nothing clinical, though.",anxiety

22049,"I (29M) started dating my girlfriend (24F) around 3 months ago. Almost a month ago we became officially boyfriend/girlfriend, and since then my anxiety has sky-rocketed. 

At the start I used to be pretty confident, always trusted her etc, but now I‚Äôm struggling. She has given me 0 reason not to trust her, but I‚Äôm always thinking worst case scenario. She is on her phone? Probably talking to another guy. She goes out with her friends? Probably cheating on me. Yesterday we were together in bed and I saw she was looking at some photos on her phone, and could see on the photo reel some pictures I didn‚Äôt recognize. The background was red, and that was everything I could actually see (I was without glasses). I immediately started thinking that those pictures are probably with a random guy, and that she is cheating on me. I mean, even if they were photos with someone else (which I don‚Äôt even know if they were photos of her/screenshots/ a random thing etc), she can have photos with friends without me thinking this. 

I know this is not healthy, and while I haven‚Äôt showed her my anxiety, I‚Äôm sure at some point I will mess up and she will probably start distancing herself. I mean, this reeks controlling behavior, right? I even had some issues with my bank that I thought she caused (not at all). This is my second relationship, my first was not great but my ex never cheated or anything, so I‚Äôm not sure what is causing this. Could it he that Im insecure? Or just don‚Äôt want to lose her? My gf is awesome and I really enjoy our relationship so far. She is attentive, shows interest, always makes time for us, cooks for me etc. I feel loved.

It is worth noting that I almost screw everything up at the beginning, as I broke up with her before we were oficial for another girl. I realized my mistake shortly after and she accepted me back (after apologizing and having a deep conversation with her). I‚Äôm constantly thinking that I don‚Äôt deserver her after that, and that if I were her, who knows if I would have taken me back. Could this be part of it?

TL:DR: I (29M) started dating my gf (24F) over 3 months ago. She has given me 0 reason to not trust her, but I‚Äôm constantly anxious thinking the worst (that she is talking with other people, cheating on me etc). This makes me fear I will eventually become very controlling. How can I address this?",anxiety

22123,"Just a vent tbh .

I've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older, I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. Ironically even therapy scares me as I'm not really one to ""open up"" in front of others in fear of burdening/boring them. Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought

On the topic of skills, I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills. I've always been told I'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. When I'm honest about not being intelligent, understandably people think I'm fishing for compliments.  Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent

As well, my social skills are horrendous. I'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause I'm just so boring and unfunny. I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. I like art but again I'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. I'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still can't move a car without sweating buckets, shaking and struggling to control it, even moving off is so challenging.  I'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. I'm bad at sports, games , mediocre at cooking and just about everything I've tried. Heck I can't even ride a bike

I couldn't list a single talent I have. Anything I'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. For example I'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. There just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for me

My anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. I sit on the bus with my hood on so I'm not looked at. Even when I briefly had a job, I couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. It was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me

I can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there. But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way

21916,"Hey all, 

Hope you're all doing alright today :) 

I've suffered from overthinking and general anxiety for a while. Being in my final year of university has been overwhelming to the point where I started seeking professional help. My doctor prescribed some beta blockers to me and asked me to take them when necessary - I've not thought of taking them until today.

I think I hit my breaking point today. I have way too much to do and I haven't been able to manage things well. I felt some aches and tightness in my chest and throat, got cold hands and feet, and starting stress sweating (the smell was putrid). I could also feel my heart pounding in my chest. I decided to check my heart rate and I was surprised to find out that it was in the mid 50s. I didn't take my first dose of beta blockers and I'm waiting to speak to my doctor tomorrow.

I‚Äôll stress about work at least 50 more times before I clock back in the next day. I mean even when I sit in my car for lunch I start getting anxious. I see my friends maybe once a month due to a lack of motivation or interest in seeing anybody. It takes a long youtube video and about 30 minutes just to tell my brain to STFU and sleep. I dwell on my fuck ups and I‚Äôm scared shitless of letting people down. I say yes to basically anything anyone asks me to do (I actually think I‚Äôm scared of what people will say or do if I say no). The anxious feeling of what if stops me from meeting new people, going to fun places with my friends and enjoying life. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore and I rarely get excited about things. I feel very emotionally numb to everything EXCEPT stress, fear, worry, and anger. My anxiety and depression was a main factor in my first and last failed relationship due to me being so numb to myself and my SO. I feel like I care about nothing. I don‚Äôt find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends, doing the things I love or anything fun. My biggest problem and the main reason I‚Äôm making this post is that I don‚Äôt talk to ANYONE about it. I absolutely hate having to talk about how I feel and what I‚Äôm thinking, even if it‚Äôs not about anxiety.  All of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only. I actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit. I‚Äôm just tired of feeling numb, I‚Äôm tired of not having fun, I‚Äôm tired of this emptiness and I‚Äôm tired of feeling and thinking so many things I don‚Äôt understand. But this has been my entire life. It‚Äôs not an on and off thing. It‚Äôs how I think and how I feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life. Im scared that no amount of work, or therapy will fix it because I feel like I basically have to rewire my entire brain and lifestyle.",anxiety

Does anyone have any idea what I can do to relax before and during my appointment and also if anyone can explain what happens during these procedures I'd be really grateful.

Also, I'm 17 so anyone have any guidance on how to tell my parents I have bad teeth?? As they expect to be perfect but due to other mental health issues I haven't been taking care of them hence my cavities 

Also, how do you know to trust a dentist? Is it normal for them to look in your mouth for like a minute and tell you what needs to happen? 

They didn't take xrays btw.

21301,"i've noticed that over the last year i've become super anxious when it comes mine and my loved ones health, i think it's because my husband had bells palsy early last year. 

Since then anything will trigger me!! literally anything. I was picking at a mole (didnt realize) and it started bleeding and got itchy and now I have this anxious feeling in my stomach even tho i know IM the one who picked at it. 

I feel like even though my brain is like yes u picked at, u probably dont have anything to worry about - that anxious feeling in my stomach is still there.

Other times if i have a headache it goes to the worst outcome. I make doc appts every so often but I also don't want to be that person who shows up so frequently for nothing and waste my docs time.

22165,"14M. As a bit of background, I am currently in therapy for anxiety , depression OCD and for the last six weeks i have been on 50mg of sertraline a day and 2 lots of 20mg promethazine a day. 

since yesterday morning, i haven‚Äôt felt great but i atleast thought that the medication was working . was feeling depressed a bit the night before but something was drastically different.

I woke up and felt like i was incoherent but i wasn‚Äôt and began to feel very depressed. i put it down to just a bad day and i read online sertraline can cause depressive feelings . i continued on with my day not worrying until the nighttime . 

just before i was going to get into bed ,something didn‚Äôt feel right. i started to feel strange in ways i can‚Äôt describe and I had these 1 second headaches in the same spot every 5-10 minutes . my memory then began to feel weird and i checked my blood pressure which was normal. 

I then grabbed my playstation controller and headset and put it by my bedside which i never do . i always leave it on my desk. this freaked me out , but then again that could just be down to tiredness .

I got into bed and checked by blood pressure again. all normal. but something didn‚Äôt feel right at all. it felt like i was living in yesterday and then i suddenly got this strange feeling and this is the best way of describing it: it felt like I wasn‚Äôt conscious but i was at the same time . like to recall my memory it feels like none of that happened except it did . the world felt deaf and it felt like time was no longer linear . i felt as if i couldn‚Äôt process things properly, if at all. and thought brain bleed.

I then went to the bathroom and felt panicked but didn‚Äôt show it . I checked my pupils and they were fine . i then went back to my bedroom and began to text people ok reddit for advice and said it all sounds like anxiety. 

at this point my brain was telling me that I was forgetting something but i don‚Äôt know what, because that‚Äôs the whole point of forgetting something . I began to feel like I was in a delirious state and i felt as if i couldn‚Äôt hang on to a thought process.

 I was worried as this was not normal for me so i woke up my dad and told him what was happening . at this point when I was trying to read something i searched up on google , the words looked jumbled and i had to read it again. this has never been an issue before and i certainly don‚Äôt have dyslexia , so this made me worry .

I explained to my dad that the way I was feeling was not normal, so i asked him if I could call 111 (urgent care number) . I explained to them my situation and i was put on call later to a man who literally asked my father what he thought he should do if i was feeling delirious . at this point i realised it was pointless . he basically said it sounds like nothing physically but i disagreed. 

Exhausted of all my options , i decided to go to sleep. I got around 7 hours and slept straight through and had vivid detailed dreams .

I woke up around 11am after going to bed around 4am. I still had memory troubles but not nearly as bad as the night before . I tried to convince myself I was fine and realised i still felt strange and the letters looked a bit jumbled still. I‚Äôve tried to brush it off all day but still feeling weird. a recent feeling in the past 6-7 hours i‚Äôve attained is the feeling like i‚Äôm waking up and suddenly realising i‚Äôm doing something while i‚Äôm doing it subconsciously . but if i backtrack and i try to remember it all feels fine. just not in the moment. this is the thing that is freaking me out . 

any advice please ? any at all? does this sound like a brain bleed /mental confusion/delirium? or could this be explained by anxiety / derealization /tiredness? so scared honestly don‚Äôt know what to do.",anxiety

21854,I'm not talking about a fear of dentists.  (Though I have that too) what I'm talking about is the fear of having something wrong with your teath. Worrying about every speck or black spot that I see.  Checking my gums constantly to make sure that they are ok.  I spend so much time in front of a mirror and a light checking to make sure there are no new signs of any dental issues.  This is on top of brushing my teeth after everytime I eat (usually). It's getting so stressful for me. To the point where I dont really have the energy to do things that I want to do or hobbies.  How the heck do I get this under control? Does anyone else suffer from this.  I think part of my fear is that A) I've had bad experiences in the past with dentists/dental work. B) I've started taking care of my teeth now but I'm worried old problems will show up. C) I don't have the finances for something to go wrong with my teeth. I save as much as I can but I don't make all that much so yeah.,anxiety

21569," Hello! Today, I (18M) fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being, unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering, not brushing my teeth, not shaving, not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and ""normal"".

  
 I recently started college, I've been making friends and generally having a great time, this, if u look at it from the outside. 

  
 Inside my head, I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically, because of my clothes, my face, my hair, because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving, because somehow I smell bad, etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads (And don't let me start with my personality), basically all this converts into me having a sort of ""Double life"".

  
When I need to go outside, I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice, smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home, my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side, I don't take care of myself in any way type or form, suddenly I am mean, lazy, antisocial and want to die once again. The cycle repeats day after day, I've been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now, but my body just doesn't respond, every fiber of my mind tells me that I can't do anything right, I will always be kinda ugly, kinda fat, and kinda gross, so why bother trying?

22017,"
Hey all, 
For context I‚Äôm 17F and in week 4 of 1L, so have just started law school. 

However, these past three years, but specifically last year was so hard on me. On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law, my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam. These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not I‚Äôd get into university. For some background, my grandpa was like my father to me. When I was younger especially, my dad wasn‚Äôt home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldn‚Äôt see him. As a result, my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them, and still see my grandma every week. As you can imagine, his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me. Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard, but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground, I went into school - no literally, 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep. 

Anyways, this was in November of 2022. I got through exams, and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas. My mind was clear, I was surrounded by family and didn‚Äôt have any responsibilities. I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 2020-2022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers. 

So I had a brief intermission of calm. I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back. Anxiety, panic attacks, derealization. Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro, which I‚Äôve been on for just under 4 weeks. The trigger? Possibly University. Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse. But I decided I‚Äôd push through, and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers. It‚Äôs been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died. Exhaustion, unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything. I‚Äôve spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal. 

Besides the mental strain I‚Äôve been under, there‚Äôs also been physical and health issues I‚Äôve been dealing with, being hyperthyroidism, and as of a week ago, iron deficiency. Seems like my body wants me to stop, but I don‚Äôt want to. Studying gives me a sense of purpose, of validation. 

I guess all I ask for is for some advice please. This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me. Thank you in advance :)",anxiety

21222," I was wondering if anybody has had nausea with one SSRI but not with some other one?

I  am taking Zoloft and nausea is pretty bad, even with the one half of 50  mg tablet. I dont know if switching SSRIs would be beneficial or this  side effect would remain the same?

What  is interesting is that I have taken Zoloft 15 yeras ago with absolutely  no issues at at all, and now I feel like I am taking a poison. I don't  understand this at all.

21574,"35 F and I need help. Apologies for typos (on mobile) and length, but so, so grateful for those who read this. 

My shoulders, chest,  back and jaw are always cleanched like I'm subconsciously trying to curl up into myself. I cant sleep, small sounds cause my heart to race and I wake up with adrenaline. I'm always exhausted, and because of this, I'm feeling so hopeless. I cry out of fear or frustration  at least once a day now making me feel pathetic and empty. I shake, have numb limbs, depersonalization and chronically check my pulse. I feel like I'm dying all the time and like someone vacuumed all the joy and confidence I once built up out of my soul.

I stopped taking sertraline after 8ish years and it's going terribly. I slowly weaned myself off because of an imminent lack of insurance back in September, and I'm not doing well. Before I went off medication,  I went part time from working a full time management position for over 12 years. At first, I was elated to be home so much. I had dreamed of being part time, accomplishing so many things at home, ( we bought a foreclosed home 9 years ago with TONS  of issues) just being less stressed in general, but because of the part time status, I lost insurance. My partner who works 12 hour days and I were not married yet, and knowing I would lose coverage and wanting to get pregnant soon, I slowly weaned myself off Sertraline as responsibly as possible. This actually went okay, surprisingly, but I'm thinking it was because I still had medication in my system. 

Before I was off meds I was binge drinking about 2-3 times per week, which has been an issue since I was 18, as well as insane amounts of weed smoking- so, additional self medication that was frankly really bad to do on meds. Drinking was ingrained in me as a coping mechanism that caused so, so many problems over the years. Being medicated helped numb the terrible anxiety and withdrawing I would go through with drinking, so it made it possible to continue this cycle for years. I am a very naturally anxious person,  from childhood until now. I am an only child who had an extremely verbally abusive father which I know caused a lot of problems. 

By December of this year I had noticed the familiar feelings of not just hints-of-anxiousness, but the crippling anxiety coming back. I drink a bit in Decemeber, and for at least five days after, would notice terrible, horrible anxiety, withdrawals and sleeplessness. This was so much more severe unmedicated I literally had to stop which had not happened consistently since my teens. Because of it being a coping mechanism, and major ingrained habit, I had some huge issues mourning a ""friend"" and psuedo-tool I had used for years to overcome social anxiety and insecurity. This was obviously never helping, but in the throes of addiction and habit, I couldn't recognize it. 
 
Then caffeine started affecting me in a negative way. Even small amounts would cause heart palpitations and severe unease. It became a gateway for a panic attack. I would usually consume a decent amount of caffeine before work, which made me feel more efficient, confident and social. Just like drinking. Now, I had lost two major things I used to cope with life. I had some peace with knowing I should have quit drinking years ago and letting it go, but now I couldn't even handle caffeine? But wait! There's more! Enter weed smoking, which I had already largely cut back. I went from smoking as soon as I got home from  work to just before bed to sleep. I have always had major sleeping issues and maijuana helped turn my obsessive thoughts off so I could sleep. Now it was causing the same panic caffeine did. I had a violent panic attack in January after smoking and almost thought I needed to call an ambulance. 

I'm sure by now, you can see I have some substance reliance issues. I know this, and I'm not proud. I should in theory be proud I stopped three bad habits/addictions AND antidepressants. Instead, I feel lost. I feel empty. I feel devastatingly hopeless. I feel truly alien, like I cant be a normal functioning human. I'm chronically jittery, exhausted and scared. I feel like although overcoming addiction I have backslid into my lowest low. I have had to leave work because of panic attacks. I dont go out to social events unless absolutely necessary, and spend the whole time in partial terror. I have no joy in anything I used to care about. I feel like I'm driving my mother and husband insane with my repetitive, obsessive anxieties, insecurities and attacks. They are so supportive, but I cant help but feel like they are a little over it. 

The last two months have been awful. By now, I expected some relief from my brain getting used to being off meds, but instead I'm now worried this is just who I am unmedicated. I obsess about the house not being fixed, people judging it,  things imminently breaking, about not being pregnant yet, ( biological clock shit) disapointing family and friends and its leaving me feeling utterly hopeless. I have been in therepy off and on for years, read countless books, every supplement out there, meditation, watched tons of videos and documentaries on anxiety, improved my diet, reached out to others, breathing exercises... you name it. I know most of the tools to help with anxiety. I've tried almost all of them.  I have held off on going back on medication in hopes of becoming pregnant, but that hasn't happened yet and frankly I dont want to start and stop medication again right now. 

I'm afraid of everything. I feel like I'm disconnected and disassociated from myself. Its unrelenting. I dont have ""good"" days, lately. Shit, I'd take mediocre ones! I have tried to push through, get tasks done around the house to feel like I'm accomplishing something, positive affirmations...nothing is working. I'm so tired. I'm so sick of being afraid of basic life tasks, like making appointments, working, social obligations, etc. I'm tired of feeling adrenaline over every sound, waking up anxious, taking hours to fall asleep because I'm anxious and dont sleep. Im so sore because I'm always clenched and tense. I'm always checking my pulse. Im always worried about horrible things happening to myself and family, health related or otherwise. This cyclical unrelenting chronic crippling anxiety is making me insane. I am considering therepy again, but past experiences have not been the best. 

I guess I'm just trying to find someone who gets it. This isn't something I feel like the average person who I've talked to about anxiety understands. Who else has panic attacks in the freezer aisle of the grocery store, work or at baby showers? My senses feel so heightened to any stimuli. I cant keep putting on a brave face and hearing people's surprise when I tell them how anxious I am all the time. ""But you're so calm! You seem so chill!"" Ugh. I must mask it well because I'm internally combusting. This doesnt feel like it will ever relent, and I'm starting to just feel anxious and depressed, chronically. I cant live like this anymore, and I'm losing all hope of improving. 

Thank you so much for reading!",anxiety

I‚Äôve also been experiencing some feelings of being off balance, muscle tension, headaches, RLS, and brain fog and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my fears really are anxiety or something worse. I saw a doctor and she told me it is probably stress related but I‚Äôm just having a hard time with all of this I‚Äôm seeing neurologist later this month but I just feel so restless and like I‚Äôm living in agony and losing my mind I wanted to see if anyone has gone through something similar and can offer any advice, Thanks.",anxiety

21280,"I'm becoming numb and I don't feel like talking to anyone. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety, but I know I have it. Even being aware, I don't feel better. It sucks. I'm a good person. I don't say that a lot but I am. Why is this happening to me? Overthinking every stupid thing, nail-biting, the constant hatred for myself and others. It doesn't help. As a kid, I've always known that something is wrong with me. But I'm too scared to tell my parents because if it's confirmed, it means I'm sick. I am not okay and I want help. But I'm so used to being the person who helps not being helped. I always put on a fake smile and am never in a bad mood; no one suspects it.

I feel so alone. I should be used to it but ever since I've got friends, I want to spend time with them. It doesn't help because we have a huge fight and I keep overthinking it. I wanted to feel better because I somehow convince myself my feelings are fake and that I'm doing it for attention. So, I took a pathology test, and the result was too much for me. The questions felt so attacking and my stomach hurt every time I clicked a yes or a no. The result was that it is 90 % sure I have anxiety. My stomach dropped seeing that. While I was happy, I was right at some point, I felt retarded. That realization that is actually something wrong with me was horrifying. I don't mean to degrade anyone, but I felt horrible.",anxiety

21491,"I scheduled an emergency tooth extraction appointment last Saturday with my dentist who I haven't been able to go to in over a year due to lack of insurance/unemployment. My partner went with me as support and also because I can't drive. The dentist receptionist lectured me for not coming in for over a year, for scheduling an emergency extraction on a Saturday afternoon, and then said they wouldn't be able to extract it that day because they ""needed to see if the tooth could be saved"" despite me saying I can't afford any other option like a root canal. They also, despite me putting my preferred name in their site portal when I first started seeing them, keep misgendering and deadnaming me even though I told them last time that I prefer my preferred name and go by he/him (I am a grown ass medically but not surgically transitioned trans man). My partner, who also goes to this dentist but has had only good experiences with them, was apparently disgusted with how the receptionists treated me this time and now refuses to go back to them for their visits. But I paid $100 ahead of time for this tooth extraction tomorrow (because the receptionists basically forced me into it by showing me all the other pricing options without insurance) so I have to go back to them before I can move to a new dentist office. My partner is working tomorrow and can't go with me, so I'm basically dreading having to hear my deadname and being misgendered and lectured and all that bullshit all over again but on my own this time. Like, it's stressing me out to the point of almost crying. I don't usually get this worked up over being misgendered because like, I'm kinda fat and my facial hair is scraggly so I get a lot of misgendering from customers whenever I'm working retail jobs, but something about them *knowing* my preferred name and having been *told* about it before but choosing to ignore it is just...

21779,"This week, I started a construction job I wasn't 100% sure about.
My coworkers and supervisors are nice people but the job isn't what I expected.

Some tasks were understated when I applied for the job and in the interview but the tasks actually require a significant amount of my daily effort. 

Also I'm underpaid relative to what I was paid in my previous job as well as no paid break. However,  the job is 30 minutes from my house so cheaper public transportation. 

So because they're nice to me, patient, and welcoming I feel very uncomfortable telling them I'll quit even though the job contract says neither party has to give notice. 


Also, I've always been an agency worker and the idea of having to give 2-3 weeks notice provides endless anxiety. In an agency job I could just phone or text and say I won't return the next day. 

I have no experience telling my supervisor I'm leaving a job",anxiety

21341,"I‚Äôve (22F) have been on anti-depressants since I was 14, but I‚Äôve never felt 100% better. I switched from Zoloft to Celexa about 2 years ago, and I‚Äôm currently taking the max dose of Celexa, but I still get pretty bad bouts of depression and anxiety at least a couple of times per week. I‚Äôm in therapy so I know of a variety of coping measures that I can take, such as exercise, journaling, spending time with friends/family, and breathing techniques, but none of those things seem to work. I don‚Äôt have any major problems or stressors in my life either, I‚Äôm just depressed for no reason 2-5 days per week.

Does this mean that my anti-depressants aren‚Äôt working, or do I just kinda need to suck it up? I‚Äôm scared to try new anti-depressants bc of the withdrawals and potential worsening of my depression, so I‚Äôm not sure what the best thing for me is to do.",anxiety

21587,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about AI recently. The explosion of Chat-GPT, Midjourney, DALLE-2‚Ä¶.someone with zero writing or art skills can spend 3 seconds coming up with a prompt and generate something incredible. Something a human would spend hours or even days coming up with. And it‚Äôs accelerating faster than we could have imagined. AI voice spoofing, AI generated images of celebrities and politicians, plagiarized college essays‚Ä¶these things were unimaginable 6 months ago. 

All this gives me anxiety and not just because I‚Äôm a writer as my profession. It‚Äôs devaluing human talent and creativity - everyone can now do it, therefore it means nothing. Over-saturation renders everything meaningless. And the irony is that humans made this tech that is now outshining all of us‚Ä¶and will ultimately do everything better than we can.

This is a pivotal time in humanity and I am not ready for it and I don‚Äôt think anyone is really ready for it. Everything from the way we work to the way we consume media will be completely upended by AI. 

I just want to rewind 20 years and live peacefully. I don‚Äôt want all this change. And it‚Äôs filling me with anxiety, hopelessness and dread.",anxiety

21680,"I've struggled with intense feelings of anxiety for years and years now. I hesitate to say that I have an Anxiety Disorder because I've never been diagnosed, but it affects my life so much that I can't be normal. I can't drive because I get too scared, I'm always terrified when I'm being driven around because I feel like we'll get into an accident or the police will pull us over, and I can't even call my family because phone calls scare me so much. I feel like I'm constantly living in fear, and I know that I want a diagnosis to help me know for a fact that this is what it is, and I really think that medication will help me. But I'm too scared to do it. I overthink about making appointments and if I have to call a doctor to make it, it's an absolute no-go. I don't know how I'm supposed to get help if I can't even take the first steps. I'm currently in therapy, which is amazing that I could even do it, and it's the first therapist that I've ever seen that I feel actually vibes with me, but I'm too scared to ask to try and get diagnosed.

21709,"Hi everyone, 

This is my first time posting on here and this may turn out to be an essay but please bear with me and read to the end. I promise to make this as concise as possible.

I'm in my late 20's (male) and have had anxiety since the beginning of high school. It felt super overwhelming back then and high school could have been an amazing experience had anxiety not gotten in the way. 

I went to university fairly late and after graduating kept landing contract work, and eventually got stuck working at the same grocery store I applied to as an undergrad. The anxiety carried over into the workplace and resulted in my inability to work at a fast pace. I always felt mentally and physically exhausted.

This is where I have to mention alcohol and caffeine, both of which produce superhuman like effects but with a caveat:

I tried alcohol for the first time in Montreal at the age of 18 and after downing 2 beers it felt like I had ingested an elixir. My worries went away instantly, and felt my brain firing on all cylinders. There were 0 negative emotions, and a profound combination of confidence, energy, euphoria, and heightened creativity. I never got addicted to drinking (for obvious reasons), and only drink on occasion, but every time I do, it produces the same effects. I also never get drunk. 

Coffee seems to produce eerily similar effects and I realized this a few years ago after I had a coffee at work and felt like I had snorted crack. I thought I could take on the world, and was super excited that I had finally found a solution to my problem. Unfortunately however, if I have coffee everyday for 4 days straight, by the 4th day it produces the exact opposite effects and I'm left feeling sleepy and lethargic. For me to feel the full effects of coffee, I need to refrain from it for at least 7 days. 

Fast forward to today where I recently started working construction as a sprinkler fitter/pipefitter and  absolutely hate it. Apart from being a fast-paced environment, I'm asthmatic with an allergy to dust and constantly drilling holes into a concrete ceiling has made my asthma worse, plus the cement we use to glue the plastic leaves me with a pounding headache during and after work, so I know my days are numbered. The company that I'm employed with is currently waiting on a new project so I've had the last 7 days off 

During this time I've begun doing research on career alternatives and have become very interested in the online world and have decided to upgrade my skills in e-commerce, digital marketing, and video editing (among other things). 

My morning routine involves getting up at 8 o'clock (feeling tired), having breakfast, followed by tea with milk (which produces similar effects to coffee with much less intensity). After having tea, my anxiety goes away and I become very focused; however, when the caffeine wears off, my anxiety returns and I go back to feeling mentally exhausted (constant worrying, overthinking, fear of failure, lack of motivation etc.)

As far as I know, I'm not depressed, nor do I have low self-esteem. I feel good about the way I look and the shape I'm in. Going to the gym helps. 

I don't have any bad habits. I don't smoke, nor do I indulge in social media looking for a dopamine fix. Most of my free time is spent reading online and on YouTube searching educational videos.  I also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night but usually wake up tired. The only complaint I have with life is my anxiety. Without it I have a powerful personality and I feel like I'm capable of achieving so much but it's causing me to operate at only 50% of my full potential.

I was wondering if anyone is able to offer any insight as to why alcohol and caffeine produce such similar effects, practically eliminating my anxiety before the effects wear off, and if anyone has had similar experiences? Could alcohol and caffeine contain something which I might be deficient in? Could I get this in a pill form?

I was thinking of making an appointment with my family doctor but just thought I'd reach out here to see what the members here have to add. 

I'm open to the idea of trying antidepressants but at the same time worried about the side effects. Do antidepressants really only cause side effects in the first couple of weeks?  Based on some of my research, that seems to be the case. 

Apologies for the long post and I would greatly appreciate any input. 

Thanks.",anxiety

22160,"How do I tell if it‚Äôs my anxiety/stress causing my heart palpitations or if I have an actual heart problem? Brief background - Changed my SSRI back in November (Bad idea) didn‚Äôt suit me at all, sent me into a depression rut &amp; only just started back on my old meds again. Starting to climb out of this rut now however I still get bad palpitations on/off when I‚Äôm feeling anxious/stressed but sometimes I can just be lying in bed or walking around &amp; get them when I don‚Äôt feel any anxiety present. Once I get them it triggers my anxiety because I fear something is awfully wrong &amp; that I‚Äôll have a heart attack etc. I definitely have cardiophobia &amp; I‚Äôm always fixated on my heart (convinced something is wrong) I had my bloods done last week &amp; they were fine &amp; tomorrow I get an ECG but I‚Äôm scared if I have afib or arrhythmia issues they won‚Äôt pick it up because I‚Äôve heard they are difficult to detect.

21291,"I'm putting myself through a university undergraduate degree as a mature student (25) and I just had my grades improve over the last two semesters. But this semester... 
My father in law had emergency surgery in January. 
I got approved for breast reduction surgery in February and had it done March 21st (this past Tuesday) and now I have to drop 1 course out of 3 because I'm failing it and can't keep up (it's an elective that's not in my field of study).
I think the stress of that course will jeprodize my recovery, but my stress isn't gone. Due to my Fs in that course, I'm second guessing myself. I have an interview this coming Tuesday to be a research assistant and have to submit a writing sample and I feel inadequate. Even though I get really high marks on my papers in my field. 

I feel like I'm not allowed to be proud of myself. To be optimistic or excited. I feel like I have to be hard on myself instead of encouraging. I sound delusional asking if I'm being too hard on myself because I know the answer... But I can't let myself believe it.",anxiety

21943,"Hey guys,

the last days after i got officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder i went without any symptoms (i guess finaly having a name for my problems calmed me down).

But two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt :/

It not a stinging pain or something that i can't manage, but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think??

It also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzy/out of myself right now :(

I went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain, so It shouldn't be my kidneys right?

This dizziness scares me so much though :(

Has anyone ever experienced something like this?

Or maybe i should really call an ambulance?

I don't know what to do i am so worried",anxiety

21866,"For context, I'm in high school. My anxiety has been super bad lately and it's been causing me to miss school a lot. My mom convinced me to go today and it was horrible.
My science teacher is a great teacher but he can be pretty harsh sometimes telling us our year is the worst, our generation is the worst, smirking when we do badly on quizzes. Despite all that stuff I really do respect him as a teacher and he's good at the material.
I just needed someone to vent to about him so I went to my counselor who I loved. She listened and offered insight but then I had to leave.
At the end of the day my science teacher pulls me aside and tells me that my counselor told him everything. He said she told him that I said stuff that he doesn't remember saying (it's definitely possible he doesn't remember but it did happen) and that I was holding on to stuff from the past which wasn't true as he says similar stuff pretty much daily. 
       The worst part is my counselor completely misunderstood one of my rants. She told him I was upset that he wasn't immediately able to help with something and that I had to wait. That wasn't at all true. And he said that he thought I would have understood so I explained she misunderstood and he seemed to believe me. I just think he believes I asked her to go to him for me so he's mad I didn't directly speak with him. He was really respectful one on one which I forget he is sometimes because of how he treats our class as a whole. I just feel really bad, I don't always agree with him but I never wanted to hurt anyones feelings. I was just going to someone I thought I could trust to talk things out. I'm not even really mad at my science teacher I'm just frustrated that my counselor went behind my back like that. I feel horrible though. I cried for 2 hours and I don't ever want to go back to school again. I feel like such an awful person. What should I do and how do I stop replaying everything in my mind?",anxiety

21459,"Preface:
23 y.o. male at time of accident

NYE 2012. I smoked a blunt for the first time, and (the equivalent of) overdosed. Legs felt weak, had to sit down.

I smoked it in at the bottom of my road, so I sat down on a neighbour so outside wall (roughly 4ft high). Next thing I knew I woke up on the pavement looking up. I later found out from friends that were with me that I had fallen head first onto the concrete sidewalk, from about 4 ft high. I am 99.999999% I had a concussion. 

Anyway, next day, all was fine - no anxiety. Obvious scars and bloody face but nothing else. 

About two weeks later, I decide to play soccer with friends. The ball hit the back of head from behind. I immediately fell to my knees, and from what I remember, was dizzy etc. then it kind of just went. 

15 mins later, we left and had a short walk to the local restaurant. Half way there, I had immense lain in my stomach and groin area. I fell to my knees again on the sidewalk near the restaurant. I then managed to walk to the restaurant and immediately went into the toilet. 

I felt sick, anxious, weird, nauseous, etc. then, cur my first panic attack. 

Even since then, a whole 12 years, I had had Generalized Anxiety Disorder (diagnosed 2013). 

How does that even happen? I don‚Äôt understand how hitting my head would cause that? Did I accidentally damage my amygdala/hippocampus when falling?

Thanks.",anxiety

21274,"On the one hand, it‚Äôs comforting to know that all of my worries about coming across as nervous or awkward are so out of proportion that people don‚Äôt even know I have anxiety. 

On the other hand, it feels sort of invalidating to my struggle, if that makes sense. This thing often consumes my life, and it‚Äôs frustrating that no one knows how hard I‚Äôm trying. They just think this is easy for me, that I can effortlessly raise my hand and speak in class like other people do. That‚Äôs not to say that I feel negatively toward the people who say this, more that it‚Äôs just generally frustrating that people have no idea. 

Have y‚Äôall thought about this too? Do you look at it a different way?",anxiety

21658,"I'm (30s F) feeling hurt by this interaction with a friend of a friend (also 30s F) who I thought might want to be friends with me (but evidently doesn't) and need help processing it/some feedback on it. On top of my social anxiety, I have other anxiety disorders, depression and am possibly on the spectrum so socializing is extra extra hard for me and I really am lacking in friends.

Here's the situation:

**July 2019:** Was at a friend's wedding out of state and met one of her other friends who lives in my state, about 30-40 min away from me. We hit it off and she said she's always looking for new friends and it would be cool to grab dinner sometime.

**Dec 2019:** I never hear from her and reach out to find out about dinner and we schedule something, but end up canceling because she has a family emergency.

**Feb 2020:** I check in about how she's doing, if she still wants to do dinner, and we schedule a dinner. Our mutual friend happens to be in town so it ends up the three of us at dinner together.

**July 2020**: Pandemic is happening. She includes me on an email invite to her bday party at her house. I don't feel comfortable going so decline.

**June 2021**: I am feeling lonely and reach out to find out how she's doing and if she'd like to go to this outdoor concert with me. She ends up not being able to make it that day, but says we should one day meet up for dinner and I agree. I remind her we had talked about some greek place that time we went out and she says ""yeah, let's do dinner soon.""

**September 2021**: Never heard from her about dinner and reach out again. She says her next two months of weekends are booked with fall activities with friends. She mentions a few she's doing that I could join. I tell her I'd be interested in this farm visit she's doing. She tells me it'll probably be some weekend in Oct, but she'll let me know the details once it gets closer and she and her friends decide the exact day.  I never hear anything.

**March 2023 (Now):** Get a random text from her asking how I'm doing. I get excited thinking she's interested in reconnecting. I'm feeling extra depressed and lonely and friendless as more friends have moved away/lost touch. She asks if I still live where I used to and if I still work remote. Yes and yes. I ask how she's doing, but she's vague only telling me she saw another friend of our mutual friend recently and that she still lives in the same town. Then, she says the reason she is reaching out to me is because she has a friend who is single and she thought of me. She sends me all his details and asks if I was interested.

Man, did I get so depressed! I thought she had been interested in reconnecting because she was interested in a friendship with me and regrets we never ended up hanging out again. I kept expecting her to suggest we meet up or something, but it turns out she is only interested in me for a potential date for her friend. I feel hurt that here's someone I wanted to be friends with who I (for the hundredth time) thought might want to be friends with me and I again feel rejected.

I know I could ONCE AGAIN ask if this woman wants to grab dinner (for the 1000th time), but I feel ridiculous at this point and like a loser. She clearly is not interested in hanging out with me or I wouldn't have had to be the one to reach out to her every time AND she would have followed up on those details about the farm visit back in 2021 that she did go on.

What do you all make of all of this?

tl;dr: Heard from someone who I had been previously trying to befriend for the first time in nearly 2 years. Thought she was interested in the friendship, but really reached for another reason. Made multiple attempts in the past to hang out with no result and feel like a loser trying again. Can't tell if she really is disinterested in friendship or if my anxiety etc is skewing things.",anxiety

I have them as needed and I was wondering can I continue using them like this or am I going to be addicted?  Like if I take 15mg once/two times per week for a month and keep two weeks pauses just to make sure?

21612,"Im feeling something hard to describe and a bit numb. I assume it has to do with anxiety, because of my breathing patterns and overthinking. 

It's triggered very easily by the confrontational tone my mom takes sometimes, it's lately about a sensitive topic. She assumes my feelings and it feels like she's arguing with me about things where there's no need to argue, because im literally just telling her how im feeling bad about the things i did wrong in my relationship and such, and she's arguing about why i keep feeling this way about it and keep blaming myself for a lot of it. She says things about my ex that i don't know how to feel about. Things like ""her life is negative and all over the place anyway and she dragged you into it"" and all that. 

I feel like when she argues with me about my feelings it's a form of gaslighting. 

I had been doing progress recovering from hating myself and seeing things more objectively concerning the relationship. 

I always feel like im pretending whenever im not doing well or when i intentionally try to get better. I never perceived i had real struggles in life. In therapy, i saw that i did have things to deal with invisibly with my family. I had set, for the last few days, on the road for feeling more authentic with myself and people around me. I felt the breakup was an obvious hurdle that i can make use of for growth without feeling pretentious about overcoming things, because of how it forced me to rethink things about myself while validating why they're there to begin with.

Mom's argument for the relationship is just that my ex was a very negative person who's carelessly trying to gatekeep me. I spiralled so hard after a tough breakup conversation where i saw it wasnt true. I hated how i couldve been convinced of that too. I hate the person it made me. I hate how in my head i was throughoit the whole relationship, and mom contributed to that. Im too impressionable with mom.

Somehow, these things are linked now that i write without inhibitions. I guess i'll just keep writing until this feeling of emptiness passes. 

But i was starting to like myself more as of yesterday. She doesnt know how much this approach of hers affects me! I was starting to feel like a more genuine and stoic person. 

Now im back to thinking in ways about my ex that im not proud of. I",anxiety

21594,"This past few months I‚Äôve had a set of symptoms that have had me worried that I have a neurological disorder. I am wondering if these symptoms could be caused by stress, and if anyone here has had similar symptoms they know to be caused by stress.

A little context, I recently got accepted into my dream job. The only hitch is that it has intense training for six months, where if you fail a test at any point you are dismissed. The material we are required to study is immense in volume and the tests are close to twice a week.

In the month leading up to the course I found myself experiencing a small head fog. It developed more and more over the weeks into the worst head fog of my life. I could barely think and always felt a sort of pressure in my head. Math I would normally fly through was difficult and even just simple thoughts were hard to get out sometimes. As the course started my vision started to feel off, not quite sure if it was/is double or blurry as it‚Äôs not that bad, but I can tell it‚Äôs off. My eyes also got super sore for a week or so. About a week ago I also started to feel my left jaw and arm go a bit numb/tingly. It‚Äôs mostly there but comes and goes in intensity. 

Since the head fog I have been chronically online in search of answers which has lead me down every rabbit hole. I am frightened i have something like MS, and though I know my research into it along with my stress with my course is more likely to blame, I can‚Äôt help but doubt that stress alone could give me blurry vision, numb arm/face, and immense brain fog

I would really appreciate anyone‚Äôs experience with stress, ms, or related symptoms.

Thanks all",anxiety

21983,"TW: self harm, suicide


Hey there! I hope this is the right place to post about this. I don't know anyone irl who deals with so much anxiety so here we go.

Since last summer I've been dealing with a lot of intrusive/obsessive thoughts about my relationship/my partner/me etc which caused a lot of anxiety. From july all the way through december I felt like I was going crazy. I felt so much anxiety and so much emotional pain to the point where I thought I couldn't function properly. I would've done anything to stop feeling anything at all. And everything between me and my partner was fine, I didn't have any reason to feel like this.

In january I started to feel a bit better (anxiety wise), but I started to self harm again (I don't do this constantly, only once or twice every few months I guess). In january and february I felt so sad and so numb that I didn't care about anything anymore. I think I also experience suicidal thoughts but I am very afraid to die so idk if I actually do experience them. I still feel a little bit anxious and I do experience self harm thoughts here and there but overall I can function decently. 

I've never been to a psychiatrist or psychologist and so idk where I should start. The thing is, therapy is very expensive and I can't afford it right now. I could afford going to a psychiatrist tho, but i don't know if my situation is that bad in order to reach out to a psychiatrist. I am scared they won't take me seriously and that they will tell me to go to therapy instead.

Do you have any advice regarding my situation? Any response would be much appreciated.",anxiety

22007,"I just got back from an eye check up for a new set of contact lenses and the optometrist told me my eyes are healthy and I just have a few eye freckles (they‚Äôre on the whites of my eyes and are light grey).

I felt sick to my stomach and want to go back to an optometrist to get them removed but I know I‚Äôm sending myself into a spiral. It‚Äôs been about two hours now and I‚Äôm starting to calm down about it all, trying to tell myself that if anything was wrong I would be told. But I hate this.

21511,"I am a 24yo male, i have suffered with gad and panic attacks ever since i was 16. 

Over the years i went to therapy and even overcame (mostly at least) my health anxiety. 
To a point that both my psychiatrist (psychotherapist? Imho not sure, English isn‚Äôt my first language) and I felt as if could go back to going to a psychologist. Everything has been going okay, i kept eating well, i exercise regularly (4/5 times x week at the gym, walks with my dog, and i try to walk around as much as i can other than my commute to work, not 10k steps on most days, but i try to stay active) 

I have been on medications. I used xanax regularly and then started using it only if needed. Once these panic attacks began, i decided to switch to diazepam, since the xanax was making me very sleepy without helping too much with the anxiety. That didn‚Äôt help. 

I started having panic attacks/adrenaline rushes for every minor incident or event. 5 mins late for a meetup/reservation? High heart rate, anxiety all the usual. Calling a client on the phone and telling them they‚Äôll have to pay xx amount? Same result. Everything minor sends me towards a panic attack/adrenaline rush. Even weed, which i smoked probably once per week on a friday evening started giving me horrible panic attacks, even if wasn‚Äôt still high yet. 

I‚Äôm really at a loss here, i don‚Äôt want to go on like this and I‚Äôm kind of worried for my health and the impact this anxiety has on it. I will bring this up during my next session, but in the meantime i wanted to confront myself with someone that has/is experiencing the same issues.

Thank you all",anxiety

21454,"Hi all,

I never struggled with anxiety like this before, when suddenly I had a panic attack for the first time last month - I felt suddenly extremely uncomfortable and ""trapped/unsafe"" in the minutes leading up to it but the whole time I was still thinking rationally. But the physical symptoms were definitely there and since then I've been having these mini bouts of extremely rapid hyperventilation just randomly through the day and tightness/pain in the chest/stomach. 

These originally happened whenever I thought any remotely negative thought at all, but now they're just popping up at random times. Currently I'm sat here with my stomach in knots and feeling like I'm about to cry for absolutely no reason at all. I wouldn't say I'm very worried about anything in particular (just the normal things I've been a little stressed about my whole life, like school) but it's getting really annoying to have these small (or on occasion, full-blown) anxiety attacks nearly every day. 

Again, this is all completely new to me. I'm prone to overstressing or worrying at times but these symptoms don't seem to be completely related to that since they come on so randomly and I feel like they would have popped up sooner during more stressful times in my life? If anyone has any insight it would be much appreciated, because it's getting really freaking annoying and interfering with my schoolwork and personal relationships. At this point would something like therapy even help me if it's so primarily physical? What do I do??? Thank you!",anxiety

21339,"Hello.

So my country is going to have an election in the fall. Politics used to stress me out much more in the past; I've since then cut a lot of the sites that were stressing me out and most days, I feel pretty good and don't really worry about it that much. My country has been ruled by religious extremists who are incredibly bigoted for eight years now- I'm so tired of their constant discriminatory comments, blatant disregard for any sort of decency and integrity and they overall just make me so tired and anxious and sad. They've started to rule when I was a teen, and I'm a young adult and they're still at the helm. It seems like they will win this year again, and another, even more extreme religious conservatist party has a chance at becoming the third biggest power.

I fell into a mental hole and I can't get out of it. I know that the elections will be in the fall and it's early spring, but I just feel so depressed and powerless. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to and that it will always just be horrible. I know that it's my brain making a bigger deal out of it than it should, but I'm just so tired of it all- can at least one thing go how I want politically?

21215," I've been undergoing therapy for anxiety and depression for the past two months. My therapist recommended that I start keeping a ""thought diary"" to write down any worries or concerns that I may have and to practice a breathing technique that involves breathing in for four seconds, holding for two, and then exhaling for four seconds.

Initially, I was skeptical that these simple practices could make a difference in something that has troubled me for years. However, I began to notice that whenever I started to become consumed by anxious or depressive thoughts, jotting them down in my diary helped me immensely. This process allowed me to break down those thoughts and identify that 99% of the time, my worries and depression stem from hypothetical situations.

For instance, one of my thoughts was, ""What if my friends are judging me behind my back?"" (for context, this was after we went out for drinks). The key phrase in that being 'What if', meaning it's just hypothetical with no real evidence to back up the worry. So, in my thought diary, alongside my worrisome thought, I would write down a 'Helpful thought' where I deconstruct this worry. For the aforementioned thought, my helpful thought was:

""This is a hypothetical worry, you have no evidence to suggest this will happen. Your friend's opinion of you shouldn't be taken seriously anyway. You don't need to seek approval from your friends.""

Of course, this may not help everyone, but I wanted to share how thought diaries have helped my mental health, and they can be quite powerful.

 TL;DR: My therapist recommended keeping a ""thought diary"" and practicing breathing techniques to help my anxiety and depression. Writing down my thoughts and using the breathing technique has helped me identify that 99% of my worries are hypothetical. I recommend trying it out.",anxiety

22097,"Has anyone had head tingling/numbness with anxiety? I spent the last 15 minutes freaking out because I woke up today feeling somewhat very anxious. A few minutes later, I felt this crawling/tingling feeling that started from my left temple to the back of head. It comes and goes and boy.....the panic I felt with it was the icing on top of the cake. There's no pain whatsoever, but just a weird sensation that makes me feel like the left side of my head is going numb.

This is the first time it's happened to me. I have been somewhat anxious these past few days (about my health), so I'm not sure if that is the trigger? I don't have any headaches whatsoever. And I'm refraining from googling because I know whatever I'm reading is gonna aggravate my anxiety. But my brain has decided that it's best to jump to the worst case scenario ü´† I'm trying to keep calm because I know if I let my thoughts run loose, it's going to make me feel worse.

But I'm really wondering if it's the stress/anxiety causing it. My neck/shoulders feel relatively fine, so I don't think it's a pulled muscle or tension.",anxiety

my friend and i were hanging out and i don't remember how it was necessarily brought up but she said ""i know a girl who is very pretty but she doesn't shower"" and then asked ""do you think she knows"" after i told her idk it depends cause for some people they do and others they don't then she asked ""btw how often do you shower?""

i've beeb freaking out ever since then that she was throwing a hint that i don't stink but i have asked two people i trust that same day if i stink and they said no but what she said was too odd and random for it to not be a hint although she did ask me for a hug before leaving after the whole thing happened so maybe it wasn't about me?

21585,"31F....
I don't really know where to start I've been struggling for such a long time and I just don't know what's an anxiety symptom, or symptom of an underlying medical condition anymore. I've had anxiety and OCD for the longest time, had CBT a couple of times in my life but I still suffer immensely with anxiety, it has taken the form of different themes over the years but at the moment I'm struggling awful with health anxiety. 

I have lots of physical symptoms, and I do have some medical issues too, and I'm finding it really hard to differentiate between the two.

My main physical symptoms are:
-tight chest and breathlessness (to the point it feels like my airways are closing up)
-strange sensation in throat and tongue
-scratchy throat
-diarrhea (sometimes severe) &amp; constipation
-abdominal pain &amp; nausea
-brain fog and intense headaches
-light headedness
-dry throat
-nasal drip
- feeling of tight muscles and tension in my abdomen, neck and shoulders
-some tingling and numbness in various areas of body

Aside from this I have been diagnosed with polyps on the gallbladder, a liver cyst and mild fatty liver recently. I have also found some small hard lumps in centre of chest/ left of abdomen just along the bottom rib. I am getting these checked but not until 17th April! 
I have really been struggling to eat recently, every time I do eat I get a lot of the physical symptoms I've described above, then I get frightened I'm having an allergic reaction and am going to develop anaphylaxis (I've never been allergic to food before, but I do have asthma) so I just avoid eating. I've lost over 2 stone in weight in the past 6 weeks. 

When I got the diagnosis of gallbladder polyps and liver cyst/ fatty liver it really set me back and panicked me. I've had two family members die of liver cirrhosis (they were alcoholics though, and I don't drink anymore, and have never to that extent) and I think I just got it into my head that I was going to die or these growths were going to develop in to cancer. 

I can't stop googling and searching my symptoms and I've come across something called MCAS, and with the physical symptoms of allergy and various growths I have in mind, I've convinced myself that I have MCAS.

I really don't know what to do to be honest, I've got a young family that I need to care for but instead I'm bed ridden and feeling like rubbish all the time and it's really getting me down.",anxiety

I work in a large corporate environment and whenever I get emails directed at me or regarding tasks related to me, especially direct asks, my anxiety skyrockets.

21474,"This might be a long post so sorry about that but I just want to have all the details. Back in December my now ex girlfriend gave me 2 weed edible gummies that were around a year old (I think) I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is true or not but I think they were each about 50 mg when brand new. This was the first time I‚Äôve done any drugs or anything like that not even weed but I wanted them from her and accepted them with a smile on my face being excited to do them. I then get home and eat them both at once and I‚Äôm feeling pretty awesome and happy but can‚Äôt really focus on anything and I‚Äôm laughing a lot and smiling at everything while on a FaceTime call with some friends. Then I start noticing my heart was beating incredibly fast and strong (at least I think it was) I thought the left side of my chest would explode and started freaking out about that. I ended up freaking out and having a almost full on panic attack and thought I was going to die and forced myself to throw up, then laid in the shower for about 2 hours on the coldest setting not realizing I was shivering and shaking like crazy the entire time I then force myself to sleep and wake up thinking I‚Äôm dead and feeling like shit for the next week or so and had weird pains in my chest. I then cut off almost all contact with the girlfriend (thinking back I shouldn‚Äôt have done this and I do feel bad I was just so shaken up because of that experience) fast forward to now I am around lots of talk about drugs I always have but about 3 weeks ago when I was going to smoke my fiends cart for the first time, just talking about it gave me these tremors and I was shaking until I calmed down about 10 minutes later but I was talking to him with a smile on my face wanting to hit his cart I wasn‚Äôt scared at all I just got these shakes, these jitters in my legs I don‚Äôt even understand why their happening when I‚Äôm actually in front of or about to do drugs that don‚Äôt even scare me just on Wednesday I was going to buy some weed (regular flower) from my other friend and I got the same trembles just texting him and had to play it off with the people next to me saying I‚Äôm cold. Basically what I‚Äôm asking is what is wrong with me? And how can I overcome these tremors/shakes when around these things this may seem really stupid or not a big deal but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs causing it please help me thank you.",anxiety

21564,"My health anxiety is getting the best of me lately. Been having eye floaters the last few years and tinnitus so I was obsessing over a brain tumor. Then lately it turned into colon cancer and pancreatic cancer due to stomach issues. Now I woke up this morning and smelled burnt rubber or something similar to it and now I'm back to freaking out over a brain tumor because I couldn't figure out if it was real or not. I did have my bedroom window open which faces the parking lot of my apartment complex and I didn't smell the smell when I went into the other room but still it freaked me out and now I'm obsessing over that. No I'm not sick and don't have nor have had covid. I've seen two old neighbors of mine die from it within months and that's the root of my anxiety with it and now with this what I think was a phantom smell, I'm terrified. And now I can't tell if what I'm smelling is real or not. I came in from walking my dog and thought I smelled the burnt rubber again but it was just my coffee brewing.¬†

I literally feel like I'm at my wits end. I can't find a therapist due to time scheduling conflicts with my job. I was prescribed a medication by my PCP but I don't like how anti depressants affect my sex drive (the one thing that helps me cope with all of this). The health anxiety is just getting worse the older I get too (35 now). It sends me into deep depressions and I feel like it's ruining my life at this point. It's like I have a choice to either be medicated and impotent or keep spiraling mentally. I hate this. I hate my brain and that it thinks this way. And I hate that you can get a fatal disease no matter how healthy you try to live your life.

21838,"Hey everyone. I'm new here. I'm writing this to be very transparent and to ask for help. I don't want to ruin my relationship or participate in toxic communication habits. 

I am finding that my anxiety really acts up when my apartment isn't clean. My husband and I both aren't the best when it comes to doing the dishes as soon as we use them or cleaning up clothes right away. But I feel like I atleast take initiative and try. I feel he usually won't start cleaning on his own unless it's his own stuff or I practically yell at him to. 

I feel like I shouldn't even have to ask my partner to care about taking care of our home. I can't be the only one doing it. I'm honestly losing it because sometimes I get so frustrated and anxious, I do get mad quickly. How do I change this? It's not even like I want to be mad, it just happens because I've reached my limit mentally. I'm not on meds, I wouldn't even know what to ask for.

I feel like I just don't wanna have to ask him to clean anymore. Why can't he just do it on his own? I don't think I'm asking for a lot and I'm made to feel like a bitch or like I'm lecturing him when I'm all I'm doing is asking me to do some chores. In fact, why do I even have to ask? I feel hopeless. I feel stuck. I can't afford a housekeeper every week right now. 

I can't control him. I just wanna know what I can do to manage my anxiety around this. And please no stupid advice like leave him because we are married. I know this issue can be fixed I just don't know where to start.",anxiety

22018,"I had a complete breakdown in December, nearly a month to the day after writing my mom out of my life.  I am mid 30s, and my therapist said I have two ptsd triggers from childhood trauma, with my mother being the largest chunk.

The ER trip in December involved barking ""Help"" but feeling like I wasn't the one saying it, and randomly losing consciousness due to hyperventilating, and intense heart palpitations.

The heart palpitations and hyperventilating happened about 7 years ago as well, and I remember doing similar when I was a young kid.

I had another panic attack last week, and my anxiety has been up and down.  Hydroxyzine for panic instances, and prozac to keep me level.

My mind instantly goes to the worst places when my anxiety is high:  it's a stroke, a heart attack, a tumor, an uncurable/unknown disease.

Thanks to therapy, I'm no longer depersonalizing/derealizing, but this just means that staying in the moment involves powering through intense heart palpitations, fear, and cold/hot feelings.

The medication brought back a handful of dreams for the first time in more than a decade or two, but only for a week.  But now, I have had a handful of ""simple"" auditory hallucinations, such as a drum beat, a beeping sound, or the sound of water pouring, all of which are coming from in my head.

Has anyone had a similar mental breakdown after removing someone like a parent?  Work has been a stressor too, but my mom was the trigger, and work was the icing.  For months before this, I was frequently tired and not hungry at all, and always stressed at work, and had a short temper.

I just want to feel normal.  Right now, things are generally ok, but when that spiraling anxiety occurs, it's really hard to break free and feel like I'm staying sane.",anxiety

21308,"I first developed severe anxiety and panic disorder in my senior year of high school. I can proudly say that with perseverance, proper medication, and the help of my lovely therapist, family, and friends, I was able to complete my senior year and begin college in the fall. I‚Äôve taken a liking to this guy in my class, and we will hang out this weekend. I am very inexperienced in the dating world as I‚Äôve only really gone out with three guys ever‚Ä¶ none of which lasted more than a few months. Though I had not been diagnosed with anxiety in my sophomore year of high school, I began dating this guy whom I was pretty infatuated with. However, the first time he put his arm around me, I shook uncontrollably. I misread that as a sign that he wasn‚Äôt suitable for me when it was just anxiety. Fast forward to now, I am anxious about seeing this guy this weekend, and I am scared that these feelings of fear won‚Äôt go away even if we continue to see each other. Has anyone else been through this? What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to be limited from dating but l my body is giving me unclear signals of what to do.",anxiety

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been able to get my meds. A mixture of Not being able to see my doctor/ refills being denied because I need to see him for a checkup.

I have a weird work schedule and his appointments are on days where I can‚Äôt make it (I work mid shift, 5 days a week). I got an appointment with him but it‚Äôs not till April 11.

I‚Äôm kind of struggling. Mainly I‚Äôm at work and if feels like I‚Äôm There but I‚Äôm not there. I‚Äôm on edge from the stress of work and school and every few minutes I feel like crying and screaming at people because recently, I feel like people are acting stupid for no reason. It‚Äôs just little things that are annoying me and It‚Äôs just so stressful.

What can I do to make it until April 11? I‚Äôm not in a crisis or anything but I just need advice, if that‚Äôs alright?

Edit: My medications are WellbutrinXL and Duloxetine. I haven‚Äôt had these since February 20th? That‚Äôs when I ran out, and I‚Äôve been taking these since July of 2022.",anxiety

21809,"For context, I'm 17, I have nasty anxiety, and next Wednesday I'm getting all 4 of my wisdom teeth out. I'm going under general anesthesia and this will be my first time. I've been pretty anxious about the whole thing but as the days creep closer it's been getting worse. I talked to my mom, who is a long time nurse, about my anxieties and she gave me plenty of reassurance but it's still just freaking me out.

I'm more worried about the anesthesia than the surgery itself/recovery. Not worried so much about not waking up but the whole idea of anesthesia as a whole just scares me. Something about falling asleep immediately and not being in control has always made me anxious. I also know all those dumb videos are mostly staged but I'm worried about not being able to control my mouth once I wake up, not sure how loopy it'll make me.

So yeah, that's it. if you guys have any advice or anything I'd really appreciate it. Thanks.",anxiety

22142,"hi anxious friends! i recently switched my meds from effexor to prozac and added buspirone 10mg for anxiety. my doctor told me to take it as needed, but after all the research ive done, this doesn't make sense to me. how would it even be effective if i only took it as needed, if it's not a fast/immediate acting drug? it builds up in your system over time, right? so i'd need to take it consistently for a long period of time to feel any effects? ill ask my doctor too of course, but im very interested in other people's experiences with buspirone specifically, and whether you took it as needed or daily. 

ive been taking 10mg 3x a day for about a month (with some missed doses in between) and i do feel less anxious, but the way my doctor described it made it sound like it was a fast acting anti anxiety drug that calms you down after you take a dose, rather than one that builds in your system over time. if it matters, i also take concerta and bupropion.

21423,I (F18) have been given the diagnosis of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. I am in a constant state of fight or flight and I‚Äôve never been in this much pain in my life. It‚Äôs the kind of pain people kill themselves from. I am constantly shaking and throwing up. This constant stress has given me the diagnosis of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I had to go to multiple doctors as IBS is hard to diagnose. The stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically I‚Äôm constantly in both mental and physical pain. However I believe it goes deeper than GAD. It doesn‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs not attacks either it doesn‚Äôt come or go.. it stays. I‚Äôve taken benzos and they don‚Äôt do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. I wish I could be sedated so I don‚Äôt have to be awake and in pain. There have been a few incidents where I had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. Luckily I found lamictal and it has saved my life. I honestly don‚Äôt think I would be alive today if it hadn‚Äôt been for modern medicine. But this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. I‚Äôm thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and I have to increase my dose every couple of weeks. I couldn‚Äôt get a therapy appointment scheduled until late June so I‚Äôm kinda fucked.,anxiety

21221,"Hello,

I've been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks my whole life, and while I take a ridiculous amount of meds for it including lorazapam, pregablin etc, I was informed about Magnesium and I wanted to share this with you.

So a lot of us get anxiety attacks triggered by the stress hormone cortisol, magnesium works by by stimulating the production of melatonin and serotonin which boost your mood and help you sleep. Magnesium also reduces the production of cytokines and cortisol, which lead to increased inflammation and stress.

It's important that you don't over do it as you can poison yourself with magnesium, and you also have to make sure it's aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms as oxide apparently doesn't absorb as well.

Speak to your pharmacist or Dr if you're mixing medication, but I have been able to reduce the amount of lorazapam I've needed since starting mag and its helped a lot with sleep. I'm truly impressed.",anxiety

22157,"The last job I had was back in October 2021 doing low-skilled IT work at a hospital and I got fired (worked there two months - the longest I‚Äôve ever held a job). 

I‚Äôm in my early 20s and it‚Äôs embarrassing to admit that but it‚Äôs true. I can‚Äôt keep a job. I either quit after a short while, or in this instance, get chucked out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I‚Äôve avoided work all together as all I feel is bitterness and shame. Another deterrent is how I‚Äôm not good at anything in particular. All I can get are shit jobs where I‚Äôm completely replaceable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm too shy and anxious all the time, so talking to people is really hard. When I worked at a cinema it wasn‚Äôt too bad because there were people my age and I felt good talking to them, but that job went to pieces because management hated me (long story). 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm told to get a skill, but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as I‚Äôve worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who I really wouldn‚Äôt get along with/tolerate. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I‚Äôve done for the past year is read, write, listen to music and occasionally socialise but I‚Äôm pretty much alone now. I guess when you‚Äôre socially isolated it‚Äôs hard to really know yourself, like you can‚Äôt test yourself much in a public setting so it‚Äôs hard to truly know who you are. I find it hard sometimes. Just thinking about what jobs would suit me, it seems impossible. I know what I don‚Äôt want to do, but that‚Äôs pretty much everything to be honest. The idea of working a job again, commuting, forcing myself to speak to people who I don‚Äôt want to be around, and doing these mundane things feels like death isn‚Äôt so bad. Considering the sort of jobs I can get, which are garbage service jobs or low-skilled office one‚Äôs with high turnovers. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I‚Äôm stuck. I feel really trapped. The job centre is harassing me and I hate going in there as I feel like such a low-life‚Ä¶ but on the same token I can barely afford the upkeeps for my car so I‚Äôll have to work some shit job soon I suppose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm not on medication or anything, I feel embarrassed typing this out. I‚Äôm scared of telling anyone my problems as I was always told they‚Äôre insignificant and I should ‚Äúman up‚Äù (even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how I‚Äôm doing). So whatever. Seeing a GP in this country is a joke anyway so there‚Äôs zero point trying to get help anyways. I tried to be ambitious and maybe move countries but I don‚Äôt even have any qualifications, like I don‚Äôt have a degree so my options are very limited. I‚Äôd love to move countries and just forget about how bad my life sucks here but I can‚Äôt do that regrettably so I guess I‚Äôll have to accept my lot in life working these miserable hapless jobs until I eventually murder myself or go crazy",anxiety

I said yes and said I will just continue to drink this one I have, but he said just get another one. For some reason he thought I was finished and said to get another one. 
He did eventually buy me another coffee so I just through out my half drunken coffee in the trash since he bought me one. I felt disappointed in myself for not being more clear. In this types of situations I have a problem making myself heard clearly and precisely.

21806,"Hi Friends- I'm struggling with the evening scaries.

I am an Aphant, inner monologue only, zero visual abilities, fact-based recall exclusively. 

I'm struggling in the evenings. Typically it would be called something like the Sunday Scaries I'm experiencing. However, it is every evening now. 

To my knowledge, I do not dream at all in any traditional sense. I'm feeling a physical, visceral reaction to going to bed. There is an overwhelming anxiety to it that is almost paralyzing. It has been happening for a while, but now I'm ready to mention it to yall. 

Once I get to bed, I fall asleep, no problem. It is getting there. It's terrifying. For some reason, my body refuses to go. I have anxiety, but this doesn't feel like worse. It feels like something else, a sense of dread or fear. 

What I've tried: cut caffeine out, eat a proper supper, and have recent blood work done. Breathing exercises, tea etc. I'm doing the things I can think of to help. 

But I can't shake it. Everyone's knee-jerk is to visualize me somewhere else, and well..... I can't. 

Any feedback would be incredibly appreciated!

Right now I‚Äôm sticking to a Xanax, unisom, and melatonin to get me to bed.",anxiety

Over the past week, my finger has gotten better but other parts of my body have really been hurting. One day, my shoulders were killing. One night I woke up and my back was killing. The next day, my legs were in so much pain. Now I am just feeling a bit of pain in my back. I am not really active and nothing traumatic happened to me either. I think I just have anxiety in general but these pains are really freaking me out.

I also got blood work done today so I'm waiting for the results. I shouldn't have, but I have been searching up my symptoms online and it kind of sounds like MS, with pain moving around my body.

21533,"Hi all,

I hope I could get some opinions from the kind followers of this subreddit!

For as long as I (27 M) could remember I had pretty intense anxiety. As a result I overthink and self-sabotage a lot. About 2.5 months ago I got into a relationship with a phenomenal woman (21F). She‚Äôs so driven, smart, witty and funny and at first, I was sure that she was absolutely gorgeous. However, these past few days I‚Äôve been wondering if I truly am attracted to her. I know this is weird, but when i look at pictures of her I find myself analyzing her facial features without even realizing it. I am constantly quizzing myself on whether I like her or not. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time it has happened. I remember the first time I went on vacation with my one and only ex I suddenly started to hyper fixate on each of her features and started to see her ‚Äúdifferently,‚Äù if that makes any sense. Instead of seeing a coherent face, i saw a collection of facial features. Her nose seemingly looked larger, and the proportions were all off. Again, I know this sounds so weird. I pushed those thoughts aside and eventually got over it (she broke up with me for a completely unrelated reason).

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has been through this as well? Part of me thinks I‚Äôm shallow for worrying about this. But part of me wonders if it‚Äôs the anxiety that‚Äôs causing this.

Thank you!",anxiety

21618,"I‚Äôve had anxiety and panic attacks since I was a little kid. Always thought I was having a heart attack. I was always told it would get better. After a decade of therapy and 6 years of medications it‚Äôs gotten so bad. I can‚Äôt do anything anymore. I can hardly leave the house. I don‚Äôt have any friends to call. My symptoms have evolved to much worse, and much scarier things. I‚Äôm coming down from a panic attack right now and my face, arms, chest, and feet felt like they were burning up. That hasn‚Äôt happened before. And I‚Äôve been having some other scary new symptoms the past week, but of course I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs anxiety or a legitimate problem. And I can‚Äôt afford to see a doctor even if I wanted to do so. A few months ago I had one where my face started going numb. I sobbed in the car with my hand hovering over ‚Äú911‚Äù on my phone waiting for the stroke. I live with my parents still, but they are going out of town for 2 weeks, and I will be completely alone. My panic attacks get horrendous at night. Recently they have given me some really dark thoughts. Sometimes I wish I was dead so at least I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this ever again (ironic because I‚Äôm terrified of dying). I think ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù? Knowing my parents are here at least gives me some sense of safety (not much, but some). But now I‚Äôm going to be completely alone.

21321,"Hello everyone, new to this community. Just wanted to know if how I feel is felt by someone else around the world. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶tired. And not because of the spring air and everything. This last few months I‚Äôve experienced record anxiety levels and they kind of stopped but it‚Äôs a loop, when I least expect it they come back. And for the silliest things too. I can‚Äôt enjoy any day anymore because of how bad the situation got. 
I‚Äôm currently in therapy, I journal, I practice sport and meditate, I try to distract myself but anything seems to work. I‚Äôve tried all the methods, I‚Äôve read thousands of articles. I feel restless and it‚Äôs a feeling I‚Äôve been carrying with me for quite a while now. My mind constantly works, elaborates stuffs even when it should shut down. 
I used to dream a lot a few months ago, and now all I do is go to bed trying to empty my head before it hits the pillow. 
Am I close to a burnout? 
I can‚Äôt focus on studying because my mind is elsewhere. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore since I‚Äôve tried everything I could. Do you have any suggestions or pieces of advice? Any techniques to calm the mind down that actually work? Thank you‚ù§Ô∏è.",anxiety

It‚Äôs not even just deep stuff. Whenever I simply text someone I worry I‚Äôm bothering them and feel really embarrassed

21964,"So to start off, I don‚Äôt have many friends and I don‚Äôt participate in many discords, so I admit I‚Äôm a little out of practice here. But recently my three cousins decided we should all be part of a group chat and rekindle the bond we had as kids. I was all for it, they‚Äôre family and I love em, but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I have absolutely nothing in common with any of them. All they talk about is work, their s/o‚Äôs and gossip. They said we would be sending each other memes but every meme they‚Äôve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos I‚Äôve ever seen. I don‚Äôt even know how to respond to them so so far I just haven‚Äôt. Now after about 3 days the group chat is silent and I feel like they‚Äôve silently moved on. I just know it‚Äôs going back to the usual where I only ever talk to them at family gatherings, which is another awkward thing I‚Äôm going to stress about. I really am at a loss of how to handle myself, and I fear that if I eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups it‚Äôll go the same way. I‚Äôve tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past, but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds.

21941,"I have been feeling super anxious and insecure recently about the fact that my partner acknowledges that he has celebrity crushes or finds other women in our life good looking. I don't mean he's asking these people out or he's making moves, I just mean on a surface level. My partner mentions, often enough, that he thinks a girl is good looking or that he finds this celebrity attractive. It really makes me anxious and insecure so I have a hard time hearing this. I know he doesn't mean anything by it, but it's really upsetting me and making me feel so worried all the time that he is going to leave me. Is it normal for guys to do this? Is it normal for people to feel attraction to other people while they're in relationships? I certainly think other men are attractive, I won't lie. But I definitely do not think about making a move on them or even flirting. I know the same is true for my partner, I'm just having a hard time coping",anxiety

21919,"I‚Äôm (F25) not sure how to write this. I‚Äôve never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between (from what little I can remember) the ages of 7-15. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X.

1. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are see-through. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. 

2. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If I‚Äôm just out a shower and wearing a towel I‚Äôll always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and I‚Äôm weak for being embarrassed about being naked. 

3. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door (caught them sometimes) before bursting in. 

4. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didn‚Äôt want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. 

5. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. 

6. X flashes me (still does) and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. 

7. X would insist on checking me ‚Äòdown there‚Äô when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. 

8. X gets into my bed without asking when I‚Äôm in bed or when I‚Äôm not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. 


The next two are hard for me to type‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic.  


9. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice (this cringes me so much so please don‚Äôt say anything nasty about this). Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said ‚Äòaww my baby, do you want to suck milk‚Äô and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I ‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt type the rest but I don‚Äôt think I need to.

10. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel (or think I did) them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it. 

Sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse (I think) I‚Äôm just unsure if it was. I know this person would take it very badly if they knew I was thinking this and I feel like I‚Äôm betraying that persons honour or something. 

(Context : been depressed since 11/12  and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at 25 I finally told a doctor and I‚Äôm on a waiting list to get help for pdsd (unsure if that‚Äôs what I have) and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth mentioning this if it‚Äôs stupid or a lie or if I am even able to). I also struggle to enjoy sex unless it‚Äôs bdsm I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs related but I just feel dirty if I am wanting it.",anxiety

21479,"Hi, I've recently started medication to help manage my anxiety. While adjusting to the medication, I noticed it helped my society anxiety a lot because I stopped caring. However, the downside is that I started to become very apathetic about everything and lost a lot of motivation to even get out bed/go to class. 

I've recently started a new medication and so far feelings of apathy/lack of productivity have improved, and I can now finish tasks (still not perfect, but I feel like with such a low starting dose it feels back to like how I've felt pre-medication.) The problem is, my social anxiety has gone back up. I'm ashamed and embarrassed to have missed so much class. I tried really hard this week and forced myself to go to classes I've been avoiding, but there is one class that I'm especially having a hard time getting myself to attend. The problem is, the class is very discussion based and we have predetermined groups we work with the entire semester. I'm worried my groupmates will judge me because I haven't been to class in so long, I just want to avoid the awkward confrontation ""Where have you been?"" even though I know it's inevitable. How do I force myself to go to class?",anxiety

My partner, is going away for 2 nights for a work thing. This means I'll be alone in the house. I have never been alone in a house, I've always had house mates or family in the house with me. Any time I was left with a house to myself I would get mates to come over and stay or I would go out. Its only at night when I have to go to bed in the house that I have the issue, I otherwise tend to enjoy being by myself. 

This whole thing is filling me with more and more anxiety. I know i'm building it up alot but its been one childhood fear never managed to sort out. 

I want to get over this, I feel quite pathetic that its causing me so much panic.

21331,"**Just in case anyone needs a TW, there is talk of medication**

**and in advance i'm sorry for any spelling errors**

&amp;#x200B;

wasnt feeling well at all and started stress eating. i tried my stratergies that i do with my psychologist but today was just one of those days if you get what i mean.

i've eaten too much, but a majority of what i've eaten is sugar which also gives me headaches when i eat a lot of it (also in case this is needed information; i dont get sugar high).

idk if i can take nurofen or panadol (Panadol is a paracetamol i think, and i think nurofe contains ibprofen) for the headache because i'm on ritalin (methylphenidate) and Movox (Fluvoxamine, i think its called something else in america though and most people on reddit seem to be from the US) and idk if some pain killers are compatable with ritalin or movox.

im also on a birth control to manage my periods (its called ""Evalyn"", i think im spelling it right, idk the science medication name off the top of my head though) but i know i can take pain killers with my BC. however it does cause mild indigestion. i though it'd be good to include this because the intestines and stomach are connected lol. 

the queasy feeling is really bothering me and i feel sickly. does anyone have any tips on what i can do to ease it? ive drank lots of water (both for the stomach ache/ queasiness and for the headache) and have my big water bottle next to me in case i need more, but it hasnt helped. just looking at anything food related is making me feel like im gonna throw up too. i've thought of sleeping it off but i struggle to nap during the day and i've already slept in a ton this morning so my body doesnt feel sleepy at all, i've tried putting ASMR on too but that isnt making me sleepy.

would really appreciate if anyone knows how to help this. i might try looking more into wether i can safely take some pain killers or not (using reliable sources so that i can make sure i'll be safe)

i'm also gonna ask on a medical related subreddit if i can take ritalin and movox with pain killers at the same time because it's really hard to find information online on my own.

thank you to anyone who reads this and thank you to anyone who can help, means a lot to me",anxiety
21286,Hello everyone I hope you‚Äôre okay. I was just playing FIFA and boom a big palpitation hit I started to panic felt lightheaded because I was holding my breath because I was so tense and then calmed down. I have had my heart checked 7 times 2 of which are private best testing ones and it‚Äôs perfect so I know it‚Äôs not going to harm me but still catches me off guard I think it‚Äôs more of the fact I was leaning forward that it felt harder and the fact I was breathing in lol. Anyway ! I was laying in bed thinking I need to just once and for all get over all of the symptoms that are making me scared of being I‚Äôll and dying. How can I do that ???? GET OVER MY FEAR OF DYING now I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm perfectly fine with death because I am not but I just thought to myself I can‚Äôt stop death and I just need to accept it. If there isn‚Äôt a god I won‚Äôt know about dying after if there is a God I could go to heaven which is great and who knows I could reincarnate and live life again. We don‚Äôt know so it‚Äôs the anxiety of not knowing which scares me and leaving my family behind. Like I say I‚Äôm a healthy 22 year old male with NO health conditions death can happen at anytime and could happen the next minute but for my age and health it is unlikely but never zero. Now I‚Äôm religious and I am sort of anxious in my mind that God is trying to get me to accept death so I can die soon lol but I don‚Äôt wanna die soon that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm scared off. That‚Äôs just my anxious mind thinking right ? I guess the positive way of looking at it is that God is getting me to get over my fear of death so I can live the LONG HAPPY HEALTHY LIFE that he put out for me. Can anyone help me accept death even more ?,anxiety

21897,"I‚Äôm a type 1 diabetic and in my teenage years it was a rough time where I fainted multiple times because of low blood sugar, some of them was so bad where I ended in a diabetes coma and other my family was pretty sure that I wouldn‚Äôt make it, I could get up in the morning and be completely dizzy not knowing what was going around, I would look at my watch and not understand what time it was, I got mri scanned and everything was fine. While being young and dumb, I didn‚Äôt really care and I thought I was immortal living life with 200 kmp even though my body was screaming after a break. 

A few years later in 21, I caught Covid-19 a pretty bad one and I have got asthma afterwards, while being sick with Covid-19 I realized that I wasn‚Äôt immortal at all, I realized how vulnerable our body really is, the thoughts started to getting into me from the times I fainted and my covid process. I have become afraid of everything and connects it with heart problems, cancer, brain tumor ect. My body can‚Äôt be doing anything before I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôm getting the worst news soon, I‚Äôm always prepared to say ‚ÄúI knew it‚Äù, it‚Äôs driving me insane, the last few months it have been brain tumor that is making me going dumb because of a tension headache even though it‚Äôs probably just work related (I‚Äôm a teacher) and because I sit and work in different positions that isn‚Äôt great for either my neck or back. 

I don‚Äôt recognize my self as said before, I have become distend from my friends, I never seen them or talk with them anymore, always finding excuses to not get out of the house, I stopped playing soccer, guess why?

21556,"I‚Äôve been struggling with anxiety since childhood and have had multiple psychiatrists, therapists and general practitioners help me try to find the right combo of meds to help me. Recently, I‚Äôve been in a 6 month long extended period of anxiety for many reasons, but we have also been trying to find the right meds. 

Talked to my psych. today and we decided to add a new medication in to try, one I used in high school that was helpful at the time, however I still felt a little sad after the appointment. I‚Äôm happy to be working toward a helpful solution, but mourning the fact that I can‚Äôt be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and will likely be on medications for a very long time.

The first semester was so bad and I remember that‚Äôs when everything stopped feeling real and I got bad derealization. I remember in class when it got bad being convinced everyone was working for the government to track me down and control me. Later next semester it mellowed down still nothing feels real idk what real feels like or is anymore. The only major difference is my mind is foggy and I am not depressed anymore for some reason. I also get mind delusions I snap out of fast. But I recently started seeing shadow people and cars speeding towards me.

22085,"Does anybody's anxiety present with just the following symptoms:

Chest Tightness

Tightness in the front of the neck and under the chin

Light-headedness/Dizziness

Feeling Faint/Like I may pass out

Nausea

These are the symptoms I've been feeling. I don't really seem to have an impending sense of fear or doom when these things happen, but I will say they are triggered by talking about my condition, or just general stress, but sometimes they happen for no reason at all. I have just been sitting watching TV, playing a video game, or scrolling through Reddit and they've happened.

I've been to the ER three times at two different hospitals in the past week with these symptoms (in addition to high blood pressure) and all three times, my blood work and ECG have been normal.

I need to add, a lot of these symptoms got worse when lying down, and got better when sitting up or walking.

In light of that last detail, the ER doctors said ""it's just GERD"" and sent me home with orders for a PPI medication and a Blood Pressure medication.

Well, the GERD has improved, and all the symptoms I've listed above have improved as well but haven't gone away.

I'm seeing an anxiety doctor later this week, and out of an abundance of caution, a cardiologist later next month (soonest they could get me in)

*Another detail: I received a call from the doctor earlier telling me my cholesterol was high and my potassium was a little high from the Lisinopril (BP med) so they started me on a diuretic and a cholesterol medication. As soon as I got off the phone with that news, I instantly started feeling the pressure in my neck and chest... This is what leads me to believe my symptoms are anxiety related.

21304,"I (17F) am in my senior year of high school. I‚Äôve sort of always been anxious, especially about people. Any time ANYTHING happens to someone I care about, even a little bit, I get such bad anxiety that I am often unable to focus on other things. 

So, as I said, in high school. When I first started high school, life was a mess. What‚Äôs important to know is that I had just made a massive transition and had come out of the closet. Not a lot of support from family, but that‚Äôs okay.

In my particular HS, we have a home room class, and you have that teacher for home room for all 4 years. When I met my home room teacher, she was incredibly kind. For all 4 years, she continued to be this way. She made cards for everyone birthday, talked to me when I was rejected romantically for the first time, and always listened. We talked to each other while getting ready for the day nearly every day for the last two years. 

This week, she‚Äôs been absent. Very strange. Then, on Wednesday, she says in a slide prepared for the sub that she‚Äôs out on medical leave for the next few weeks. It wasn‚Äôt planned, you could tell from the way she talked in the slides of the previous days. 

I find out that she‚Äôs in the hospital, but fine. INSTANTLY, I‚Äôm full of anxiety, feeling like my soul was removed from my body. I‚Äôm just worried, like, a lot. I KNOW she‚Äôs fine, as far as everyone knows. I also led an effort for a ‚ÄúGet Well Soon‚Äù card, being given to her by another teacher she‚Äôs friends with. I don‚Äôt really know how to just patiently wait for the 3-4 weeks until she gets back. 

I‚Äôd also like to say that I KNOW she‚Äôs fine. My brain does not seem to feel the same way, especially when I‚Äôm not actively doing something distracting.

TL;DR my teacher is sick and in the hospital and I have a strangely large amount of anxiety, even though everyone says she‚Äôs fine.",anxiety

Hello 20M and I quit vaping 3 months ago after vaping for 4 years and I have no plans on going back. Picked up this habit in high school (peer pressure) and it continued because I was in the same group of friends since then. Vaped here and there in high school and every damn day in college. Chain vaping 55 mg nic salt pretty much. Obviously this is my fault, but I can‚Äôt help but think my future is uncertain and I probably fucked up my health. My lung has been feeling weird for a few months now and it‚Äôs causing me anxiety. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I don‚Äôt even want to do anything in college that could help my career because I think I‚Äôm going to die in the near future. Like what‚Äôs the point. Im convinced I‚Äôm going to die from lung cancer sometime in the future or cardiac issues. I‚Äôve been having chest pain and it‚Äôs scary. I take an snri rn and it‚Äôs helping but the thoughts won‚Äôt go away. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I‚Äôm reconsidering my whole life because I feel like I ruined it. I‚Äôm very depressed and anxious about it and I wish I knew vaping was absolutely terrible for you before I even started. I know this post may seem dramatic but this is what goes through my head every morning until I sleep. I keep thinking it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be this way. I‚Äôve gotten straight As my entire life, been going to the gym, eating right. Im in college about to go into a career path that‚Äôs exciting and the future potentially could have been great but I have my one single vice that I was too stupid to quit. Damn idk I just needed to vent because it gets exhausting. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this kind of stuff. Obv my parents don‚Äôt know about this they just think I‚Äôm very distressed and depressed about school or smt. I see all of my peers off doing amazing things with their lives and I‚Äôm just going through this bs. It‚Äôs pathetic the person I‚Äôve become. Younger me would‚Äôve died if he saw what I turned into. Throwing away life it seems like just for a little buzz. I‚Äôve been trying to get my friends off this shit too but they prob see me as biased due to my health anxiety with vaping.They are great but I can‚Äôt help but feel I wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation if I stayed away from the red flags. Once one person starts doing it it‚Äôs like dominos and no one thinks twice about it being bad. Damn my whole life building up to smt and I just jeopardize it over bullshit. I just needed to vent, the health anxiety is getting bad to the point where Im certain cancer or a heart attack is coming and there‚Äôs no point anymore.",anxiety

21979,"I have this real weird thing that happens to me.

So besides my work life, I have potential academic plans. I love studying, reading, writing. I have so many ambitions with all these things I want to write. I might even publish them. I spend a lot of time-effort on these studies I do on my personal life.

The weird thing is, whenever I go into focused studying, the idea that I will die anyways comes to my mind. I start to feel like this effort is for nothing, that I will die eventually, maybe even soon. I read about these scholars of the past, and see that some of them died so young. What will all this information help me with if I am going to die anyways? Will I have enough time to categorize-interpret-publish so much knowledge?

Anyways, lots of anxious thoughts suddenly rush to my mind about mortality. I had this back in uni as well. I remember when I studied a lot during my masters, I would always start thinking about my mortality and whether all the work I do is even worth it....

Is there a scientific explanation to this? Why would studying in a focused manner put me in such an  existential crisis each time?

Every time i open tiktok, theres this tarot lady giving her readings. At first i was like, ok... Maybe its some random thing, but lately this tarot stuff is appearing everywhere on my fyp. 

I have relationship anxiety and general anxiety too (im working on it), and i have a bf. 
The thing is, all this tarot readings are, since day one i downloaded the app, saying that my bf doesnt love me or that he's gonna break up with me. I know its not true but they still manage to put me in a anxious state. 

Literally, a couple of mins ago a video of those appeared and well, it gave me a panic attack.

I dont know what to do anymore, blocking that kind of content is no use and deleting the app isnt a solution too. I've tried it before but those videos start appearing on my instagram and facebook.

first he said something to me while i was signing something. i said ‚Äúhmm?‚Äù and stared at me for a few seconds before saying nevermind. from that moment on, i was anxious, thinking about him talking more and me not being able to hear him.

he did end up talking again. he asked me which side i wanted the piercing on. i said ‚Äúhmm‚Äù three times because i just couldn‚Äôt hear him. he stared at me for a few seconds before saying it one more time, slowly and in a seemingly annoyed tone. 

i was so ready to leave the shop. he said to come back if i had any issues with my piercing.. i really hope i don‚Äôt have any. i‚Äôm already thinking about me not being able to hear him again and him staring me down while looking annoyed.

21999,"So I‚Äôve always had an aspect of social anxiety within me, usually in groups of more than 3 or 4 people. One on one or in a group of 3 in absolutely fine.

I had some bad experiences of speeches and presentations back in high school and totally avoided it throughout my adult life.

I‚Äôm now 31 and the only public speaking (if you can calll it that) I‚Äôve done is a hand full of interviews to no more than 3 people. 

I‚Äôm my brothers best man at his wedding in a few days and I‚Äôve got to do it in front of 100 or so people which seems absolutely alien to me. My heart races and I get sweaty palms just thinking about it or practicing in front of a mirror. 

I hate the sound of my own voice and it just begins to break/shake and I go bright red and my mouth makes this involuntary frowning thing like I‚Äôm about to cry whenever I‚Äôve had to do it in the past. 

I‚Äôve read online countless tips and advice but I just don‚Äôt feel these people have it half as bad as I do? I‚Äôve resorted to getting a low dose of diazepam from my doctor (only 6 2mg tablets) and they have told me to take a maximum of 3 of theses before the speech. Will this honestly help? I appreciate the concerns about mixing alcohol and diazepam but I do believe that is a low dose and I only plan on having 1 or 2 small bottles of beer before the speech.

Any tips/advice? 

TIA.",anxiety
